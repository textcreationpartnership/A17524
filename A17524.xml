            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The pardon of <hi>Dumnorix</hi> is ob≈øervable: his naturall clemency induced him to it, ≈øuffering him≈øelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the intreaties of his brother <hi>Divitiacus</hi> whom he loved: Neverthele≈ø≈øe he cau≈øed heed to be taken to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, that ≈øo he might receive no new inconveniences by him afterward.</p>

                        <p>The third is the confe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Ce≈øar:</hi> who freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that his armie was a≈ø≈øaulted ≈øo unex≈øpectedly and couragiou≈øly, and in a countrey ≈øo inclo≈øed, that it was neither his cu≈øtomary order which ≈øaved him (for he had no lei≈øure to embattel) nor his exhortations, nor his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in all parts (for he was forced to fight in the place he then was in) but he attributed the ≈øafetie thereof onely to the continued di≈øcipline of his ≈øouldiers, which knew of them≈øelves to range where they ought, &amp; to that that he ever made all his officers exactly ob≈øerve the performance of their duties, whilest the intrenchment of the camp was a making; ≈øo that in all parts were found ≈øome ready to command, and others to obey; which made good the re≈øi≈øtance, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the affrightment.</p>

                        <p>We will further ob≈øerve that <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> in all the≈øe actions by no diver≈øitie of making warre was ever astoni≈øhed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were a≈ø≈øaulted in open field or in his camp, whether ≈øurpri≈øed, or whether his enemie retired into places inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øible; alwayes finding them out in all places, and that without omitting one onely point of militarie di≈øcipline.

here learn how to deal with ≈øuch as ≈øave them≈øelves by flight and by retiring into inacce≈ø≈øible places: wherein many Commanders have failed for the not ob≈øerving of three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall things, which <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> did: Fir≈øt, to prevent the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by ≈øuch extraordinary diligence, as to ≈øurpri≈øe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be able to retire them≈øelves or their victuall into the forrests; ≈øo that by this means you may con≈øtrain the one to yield, and the other to peri≈øh through famine.

The example we have in this book of <hi>Q.

                        <p>We will conclude the ob≈øervations of this book with the ≈øtratageme of <hi>Labienus:</hi> who, de≈øirous to fight with tho≈øe of <hi>Triers</hi> before the <hi>G rmanes</hi> were joyned to them, re≈øolved to make it publickly believed that he was afraid of them, and that he would retreat; knowing right well that there were <hi>Gauls</hi> in his own army which would di≈øcover it to them; and in the mean time gave order ≈øecretly to retreat with a great noi≈øe, &amp; making ≈øhew of much fear: whereof they of <hi>Triers</hi> having intelligence, without ≈øtaying for the <hi>Germanes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they ought not to let ≈ølip the occa≈øion which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ≈øelf unto them, pa≈ø≈øed the river, and came di≈øorderly as to an a≈ø≈øured victory: but <hi>Labienus</hi> turneth upon them in good order, and defeateth them.

                        <p>ALl <hi>Ce≈øars</hi> other warres in <hi>Gallia</hi> have been made by divided parts, having made u≈øe of their divi≈øions to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine them; but this, by a generall con≈øent of almost all: they cho≈øe one ≈øupreme Commander, great in prudence &amp; courage, who, well perceiving that the good di≈øcipline of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> and their knowledge in the art military, made them invincible by way of battels, changed his own way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre again≈øt them, and by prolonging time without hazarding a generall battel, finding him≈øelf ≈øuperiour in hor≈øe, and the countrey to friend, not ready to ≈øupply their armies with victuall, made ju≈øt account to have ruined them: whereupon we may make very good ob≈øervations.</p>
                        <p>First, upon <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> who having been by a generall con≈øent cho≈øen Generall of divers States (which had emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one towards another) hath known ≈øo well how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, that what adver≈øitie ≈øoever he met with in his affairs, he hath alwayes mainteined him≈øelf in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and aw amongst them; not ≈øparing to be ≈øevere where occa≈øion required (fear being the most powerfull means to keep men in order:) ill ≈øucce≈ø≈øes never being able to deject him or dimini≈øh his confidence. Even at that time when he was accu≈øed to have had intelligence with the enemy, he ≈øo boldly defended him≈øelf by an oration, that he came off more authori≈øed then before. Al≈øo it is an efficacious means to continue ≈øeverall people in a fair ob≈øequencie, to parle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with them upon ≈øuch affairs as happen. He had the power to make them ≈øet fire on above twenty cities to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their enemies, which argued his great judgement,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7521:20"/>
for it was the onely way to have overcome the <hi>Romanes</hi> (≈øtronger then they in battel) to have fought with them by famine. And in ≈øuch affairs all moderate coun≈øels, or but half executed, are ruinous: as the taking of <hi>Bourges</hi> ≈øerveth us for a memorable example, for the ≈øaving of it from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pre≈øerved it for the benefit of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> which (by taking thereof) found therein ≈øuch commodious things as they ≈øtood in need of. His great credit is very remarkable: for to a free people at the beginning of a warre, before they had ta≈øted of bad ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, and in their hope to be able to overcome without being driven to ≈øo ≈ømart remedies, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth with them to fire their hou≈øes and goods, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation whereof warre is for the mo≈øt part made. It was a very hard enterpri≈øe, for that the lo≈ø≈øe of things certain and pre≈øent which we ≈øee and feel, is preferrable (with the ignorant) to things whereof the events are uncertain, and the benefits remote; and no man can well apprehend this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that hath not experimented it in the government of the people. He hath be≈øides ≈øhewed his con≈øtancy even to the end, and made no ≈øcruple (being the chief of ≈øo many ≈øeverall nations) to be ≈øhut up in a citie, where he did all that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and brave Generall ought to do, and hath ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted hunger and the di≈øcommodities of a ≈øiege, having held out even untill his relief was repul≈øed and defeated; but becau≈øe hi≈øtories make not but for the victorious, we ≈øee u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally none had in esteem but the ≈øonnes of fortune.</p>
                        <p>Now let us examine <hi>Ce≈øars</hi> carriage in this warre, which brake out he being in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the depth of winter, his army di≈øper≈øed in ≈øeverall countreys, far di≈øtant from each other, and the revolted States ≈øo in his way, as it was almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible for him to unite his legions. In ≈øo great difficulties he findeth no other means but to ≈øurmount them by incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable labour, wherewith he maketh way over the mountains covered ≈øix foot thick with ≈ønow, and affrighteth his enemies more appearing in the midde≈øt of them (when they believed him ≈øtill in <hi>Italy</hi> and out of po≈øsibility to get to them) then by his great forces. He al≈øo added to this a≈øtoni≈øhment by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, cau≈øing his cavalry to ≈øhew it ≈øelf in ≈øeverall places at one and the ≈øame time, to cau≈øe a belief that he was very powerfull.</p>
                        <p>Let us further con≈øider that <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> ≈øeeing the fa≈øhion of the warre changed, and that the enemy avoided battel, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him≈øelf to ≈øieges, wherein he ≈øheweth him≈øelf no le≈ø≈øe a

                     <p>The ≈øecond example is, when <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of hope of being relieved by <hi>Pompey</hi>) took a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution to ≈øave him≈øelf within <hi>Corfinium,</hi> where he was be≈øieged: but for that his countenance was ≈øadder then u≈øuall, his ≈øpeeches le≈ø≈øe re≈øolute then the time required, and by ≈øome neglect of the nece≈ø≈øary works for the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen≈øe, he di≈øcovered to his ≈øouldiers that which he would have concealed from them, ≈øo that (preventing his flight they delivered him unto <hi>Ce≈øar.</hi> It is a fair le≈ø≈øon for a commander, to teach him that in greatest danger he ought to ≈øhew mo≈øt re≈øolution; for his ≈øouldiers become courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or fearfull according to that they ob≈øerve in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7521:26"/>The third is, when <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> di≈øcovered the fear of <hi>Afra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> ≈øouldiers, in that they ≈øeconded not each other, that they ≈øcarcely had received the brunt of the cavalrie but their en≈øignes were all on a heap, that they made not good their ranks nor distances, and that they ≈øtirred not from the field of battel where they could not ≈øub≈øi≈øt for want of water.

                     <p>IT is a maxime held by all, and neglected by mo≈øt, That in the time of truce there ought to be a better guard then at any other time. We have here a notable example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Trebonius</hi> by a marvellous labour had brought the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeillians</hi> to the la≈øt ga≈øp, when during the time of a truce (which out of pitie he had granted them) his ≈øouldiers ≈øo neglected their guards that they invited the enemie to their ruine, and he ≈øaw in one houre burnt what had co≈øt him the labour of many moneths. Which ≈øhould teach us in warre never to ≈ølacken the ≈øeveritie of military di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, though the ≈øouldiers grumble never ≈øo much: for you ought rather to content them by any other means then that; and when they ≈øhall ≈øee their commanders ≈øhare the dangers and labours of the warre with them, they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo them chearfully. For we may reade that by the exact ob≈øervation of military di≈øcipline many commanders have ≈øurmounted great difficulties and obteined glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that many others for di≈øregarding it have been ≈øhamefully defeated; but it hath never been read that the ob≈øervation thereof hath been the cau≈øe of the lo≈ø≈øe of one battel or of the overthrow of any one enterpri≈øe.</p>
                     <p>A great courage without experience is likelier to commit a great errour in warre then a more temperate one: for the fir≈øt is u≈øually accompanied with pre≈øumption, and is more incapable of coun≈øel then the other; e≈øpecially when he hath made his entrie into armies by ≈øome happy ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe. <hi>Curio</hi> is a fair example thereof, who of a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune</hi> of the people ≈øeeing him≈øelf a Generall of an armie,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7521:28"/>
committed many errours, and tho≈øe not ≈ømall ones: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had the good hap to beat his enemies, to ≈øhut them up into <hi>Utica,</hi> and upon the news of king <hi>Juba</hi> his coming to re≈øolve for the be≈øt, which was to retreat into his camp on the ≈øea-≈øide, well fortified and well provided of munitions, there to attend the re≈øt of his armie; upon the fir≈øt news that was brought him that the relief was weak, and that <hi>Juba</hi> was not there in per≈øon, without ≈øtaying for confirmation thereof, refu≈øing to advi≈øe with, or give credit to any, he cro≈ø≈øeth his first re≈øolution, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give them battel; after which his cavalrie meeting with ≈øome of <hi>Juba's</hi> hor≈øe, of which foure were brought pri≈øoners to him, he asked who commanded them; they an≈øwering that it was <hi>Saburra,</hi> he pre≈øuppo≈øeth that <hi>Juba</hi> was not there; ≈øo confirmeth him≈øelf in the fir≈øt errour, and marcheth ≈øo fast and ≈øo farre as that he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf five and twentie miles from his camp, in a countrey which he knew not, with part of his forces (the re≈øt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to follow) much hurried and in di≈øorder: which was the cau≈øe that <hi>Juba</hi> ea≈øily defeated them. Which ≈øheweth us plainly, that neither a great courage alone maketh a good commander (however it helpeth well thereto) nor the reading of books, nor abilitie of di≈øcour≈øe; but it mu≈øt be atteined by long experience, and the being pre≈øent at many overthrows as well as victories: for he that hath not had his ≈øhare therein, is not able to imagine what belongeth thereto, the bravest ≈øouldiers ≈øometimes doing the poore≈øt actions, as it happened here; where (though the re≈øidue of this armie was retreated into a well-forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied camp, and not a≈ø≈øaulted, yet the≈øe imbarked them≈øelves ≈øo confu≈øedly and di≈øorderly as that a great part of them were drowned.

But as this beginning was much ≈øhort of his ordinary prudence, ≈øo the progre≈ø≈øe and the end thereof ≈øurpa≈ø≈øeth all his other actions; and it ≈øeemeth that he hath not here erred but to make his vertues ≈øhine ≈øo much the brighter. This hath been a warre without rule: for he hath been put to defend cro≈ø≈øe wayes of ≈øtreets, and to barricado him≈øelf there, to di≈øpute the one half of the town again≈øt the other, to remedy unthought of accidents, to rea≈ø≈øure his ≈øouldiers, to fight with a navall army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øouldiers, and to beat them; and, as if he were fallen into another world, to make a warre after a new manner. Which ≈øheweth that he excelled in three things principally; namely, that he was never left hopele≈ø≈øe, that he was of great experience, and that he confounded not him≈øelf in his commands.</p>
                     <p>This warre fini≈øhed, he goeth against <hi>Pharnaces;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we will onely ob≈øerve two things: the fir≈øt, that how≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he de≈øired to fini≈øh this war ≈øpeedily, becau≈øe his bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe required him el≈øewhere, yet he goeth not to a≈ø≈øault him ra≈øhly, but alwayes beginneth by encamping him≈øelf ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then (having left his baggage in ≈øafetie) he goeth with all his armie to make another camp near to <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> leaving a great valley between both; to the end that if he would hinder him from fortifying there, and a≈ø≈øault him, he could not get to him without great di≈øadvantage. The other is to ≈øhew the advantage which he hath that a≈ø≈øaileth: for <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> him≈øelf ob≈øerveth, that though <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi> a≈ø≈øaulted him ra≈øhly, yet his ≈øouldiers were ≈øtruck with fear, and put into ≈øome di≈øorder upon their fir≈øt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch. Which may ≈øerve to confirm that he which a≈ø≈øail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hath a great advantage, and that there is nothing more nece≈ø≈øary in warre then retrenchments.</p>

                        <hi>CE≈øar</hi> hath done three things in this warre which came near to ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe: the fir≈øt, to pa≈ø≈øe into <hi>Africa</hi> in the dead of winter with a ≈ømall force, not having any a≈ø≈øured port there, for which cau≈øe he was not able to appoint any <hi>Rendes-vous</hi> for his ≈øhipping; which thing was imputed him as a want of fore≈øight. Neverthele≈ø≈øe after his pa≈ø≈øage his manner of proceeding was altogether admirable: He maketh choice to encamp him≈øelf near the citie <hi>Ru≈øpina,</hi> which was within half a league of the port, which he joyneth to the citie and his camp, and fortifieth it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: for from thence he had one foot on land and the other on the Sea, and could (as occa≈øions ≈øhould require)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7521:36"/>
act by either ≈øea or land, and be ≈øecured from being ≈øhut up, what≈øoever ≈øhould befall. This is a good le≈ø≈øon for ≈øuch as enterpri≈øe upon a forrein countrey, being weak at the beginning: for in this po≈øture great attempts may be withstood, and in all extremitie a good retreat may be made. The ≈øecond, to leave his army near <hi>Ru≈øpina,</hi> and without giving knowledge to any man to ca≈øt him≈øelf abord to go ≈øeek his ≈øhipping. And the third, having news of the defeat of his fleet, to leave his camp, to hasten in full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to <hi>Leptis,</hi> to ca≈øt him≈øelf into a ≈øhip, and to rally others, and a≈ø≈øault the enemies: and although he peri≈øhed in none of them, there can be nothing ≈øaid in his defen≈øe, but that he tru≈øted wholly to his good fortune, and that he never was wearied or di≈øheartned in the mo≈øt dangerous or laborious de≈øignes.</p>
                     <p>It is ob≈øervable that <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> in all his warres hath alwayes been inferiour to his enemies in number; for which cau≈øe he hath alwayes helped him≈øelf by fortifications, more then ever any other hath done, which he made much the better when he found him≈øelf not ≈øufficiently ≈øtrong to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as he was a long time in <hi>Africa;</hi> in≈øomuch that <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> him≈øelf wondered at his coldne≈ø≈øe: neverthele≈ø≈øe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued his ≈øouldiers in exerci≈øe, and him≈øelf exerci≈øed new-levied men, and entred them by ≈ømall ≈økir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øhes, wherein by his indu≈øtry for the most part he had the be≈øt; and alwayes attempted ≈øomething upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

                     <p>Concerning the cavalrie, they alwayes placed them on the wings: and whether it were the cavalrie or the infantery, they changed the form of their order according to the ≈øite of the places, or to the number of the enemies forces with whom they had to do, or to the order wherein they were ranged into battalia, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the front by le≈ø≈øening the depth, &amp; doubling their front by the half files, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> did in the battel which he fought agai≈øt <hi>Cre≈øus;</hi> for fearing to be overwinged, he made his files (which were 24 deep) but 12, and ≈øo augmented the front of his army by the one half.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides they made u≈øe of ≈øeverall orders of battalia according to occa≈øions; as the Orb, and the light-armed in the middle, to ≈øu≈øtein a ≈øtrong charge on all parts; or the Wedge, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enter into a battalion; or a Half-moon to enclo≈øe or overwing; and others, which are of no great u≈øe in the≈øe times.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7521:41"/>
after the foundation of the citie, they cho≈øe out the able≈øt of this fifth <hi>Cla≈ø≈øis</hi> to make them ≈øerve at ≈øea; and yet they obliged them (in ca≈øe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitie) to ≈øerve twentie years among≈øt the land-forces.</p>

They were obliged during the≈øe twentie eight years to ≈øerve fifteen: and when they had accompli≈øhed their ≈øervice, they were no more tied to take arms, but onely for the guard and defen≈øe of the citie.</p>
                     <p>After that the kings were driven out of <hi>Rome,</hi> they cho≈øe every year two <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> in their ≈øtead: Then tho≈øe <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> cho≈øe twenty foure military <hi>Tribunes,</hi> but afterwards the people would choo≈øe them: fourteen of them were to have ≈øerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready five years in the warres, and the other ten a longer time; namely in the infantery, eleven years; and in the cavalrie, fifteen years: which ≈øheweth what e≈øteem they had of their foot above their hor≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> every year called out of all the <hi>Tribes</hi> ≈øuch as were from ≈øeventeen yeares of age to fourtie five to the <hi>Capitole</hi> or to <hi>Campus Martius:</hi> and ≈øuch as dd not there make their appearance were rigourou≈øly puni≈øhed; which was ea≈øily di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, for by the ordinances of <hi>Tullus Ho≈øtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> they kept a regi≈øter of all that were born, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7521:41"/>
that died: now they of the territorie were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned into the number of inhabitants as well as they which dwelt within the citie.</p>
                     <p>They alwayes cho≈øe foure Legions, two for each <hi>Con≈øul;</hi> ≈øometimes they levied more, but very ≈øeldome, and that according to the nece≈ø≈øitie of their affairs: And even in the time of <hi>Hannibal</hi> they had twentie three Legions, and yet every <hi>Con≈øul</hi> had but two, the re≈øt being commanded by <hi>Praetors, Procon≈øuls,</hi> and other officers. But after that the Common-wealth grew more powerfull, and their laws grew weaker, there have been under <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> in the warres of <hi>Gallia</hi> ten Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
                     <p>Before they proceeded to election of their ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they divided the twentie foure <hi>Tribunes</hi> among≈øt the 4.

                     <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> being thus di≈øparted and divided into foure parts, the <hi>Tribes</hi> were drawn by lot; and of the fir≈øt they cho≈øe foure men of a like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as near as could be: of the≈øe foure the ≈øix <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the fir≈øt Legion cho≈øe one; the ≈øix of the ≈øecond cho≈øe the ≈øecond; the ≈øix of the third, the third; and the ≈øix of the fourth had the fourth man Then they cho≈øe foure more, whereof the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the ≈øecond Legion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to choo≈øe the fir≈øt; they of the third, the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;

                     </p>
                     <p>Then they were armed, and therein they ≈øometime varied: but mo≈øt u≈øually the arms of the <hi>Velites</hi> were a morion, a ≈ømall target, darts, and a ≈øword. Their archers and ≈ølingers were called extraordinary, and were auxiliars. The <hi>Hastati</hi> bare targets of foure foot high, an head-piece, and a ≈ømall brea≈øt of the cuirace: The richer ≈øort of them bare the whole cuirace, a ≈øword on the right thigh, (being ≈øhort, broad, and ≈øharp-pointed, and cutting on both ≈øides) and two darts to ca≈øt. The <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> bare the like arms; onely the <hi>Triarii</hi> in ≈øtead of darts had javelins.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Cavalrie; that was but ill armed at the beginning; but it learned of the <hi>Grecians</hi> afterwards to be armed with a cuirace, a buckler, and a ca≈øting-javelin.</p>

                     <p>A Legion was alwayes divided into five bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: namely the Infantery into foure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, called <hi>Velites, Hastati, Principes, Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii;</hi> and the Cavalrie into one. Every body was divided into ten troups, which among≈øt the Infantery were called <hi>Cohorts</hi> or <hi>Maniples,</hi> and among≈øt the Cavalrie were called <hi>Turmes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the three fir≈øt orders of Infanterie were 1200 ≈øouldiers apiece, each of which make ten

troups of 120 ≈øouldiers: and in the la≈øt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Triarii,</hi> there were onely 600 men, which make ten troups of 60 men apeece.</p>
                     <p>The body of Cavalrie was of 300, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ten troups of thirtie ≈øouldiers apiece.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of marching.</head>
                     <p>WHen they were to march, at the fir≈øt ≈øound of the trumpet they took down their pavilions, and packed up the baggage; at the ≈øecond they loded it; and at the third they parted away from their quarter: But none were allowed to take down their pavilion, untill the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> had taken down theirs. The extraordinaries marched fir≈øt; then the right wing of the Allies, and their baggage in their rear; then the ≈øecond <hi>Legion,</hi> and their baggage after them; then the left wing of the Allies, and their baggage following them: the cavalrie was in the van and rear, and ≈øometimes in the flanks, thereafter as the enemy was to be ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpected.</p>
                     <p>Every <hi>Romane Legion</hi> with one wing of the Allies marched in the van by turns, that ≈øo
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7521:44"/>
every one might have the commoditie of arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fir≈øt at the camp.</p>
                     <p>If in the march there were greater ≈øu≈øpicion on the rear then on the van, or on the flanks, they ≈øtrengthened them≈øelves there accordingly. This was their ordinary manner of marching; but I find in <hi>Ce≈øar,</hi> that when he marched in an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies territories, and particularly in a countrey inclo≈øed with hedges and woods, he made all the Legions to march in one body, then all the baggage together, leaving onely ≈øome new-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied troups on the rear thereof to guard it. When the army marched in three equidi≈øtant bodies, namely all the <hi>Ha≈øtati,</hi> a≈øwell <hi>Romanes</hi> as <hi>Allies,</hi> together, having their baggage before them, then the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> in the ≈øame order, the extraordinaries and cavalrie were to be on the flanks and on the van to ≈øecure the baggage, or at lea≈øt on tho≈øe parts where the mo≈øt danger was: And being ≈øo ordered, when an occa≈øion of fight befell, on what part ≈øoever it were, on a ≈øudden all the troups could be drawn out very ea≈øily (without being troubled by the baggage) to go and affront the enemy.</p>
                     <p>When the army drew near to the quarter, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Centurions</hi> ordained for that work marched before to con≈øider of the ≈øite of the camp: Which being made choice of, they fir≈øt marked out the place for the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or of the Generall, with a white banner; then they di≈øtingui≈øhed his lodging from others by a red banner; then with a ≈øecond red banner they marked out the <hi>Tribunes</hi> quarters; then with a third they divided and di≈øtingui≈øhed the lodgings of the Legions from the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7521:44"/>
ones: after that they gave to every one their proportion of ground, which they marked with banners of other colours: then with a line they quickly marked out and divided all the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, becau≈øe they never changed the mea≈øures nor form of the camp; and that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well accu≈øtomed thereunto, by having alwayes the ≈øame way of encamping.</p>
                     <p>When the army arrived, every troup took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their lodging by the marks and banners; ≈øo that all went to them without confu≈øion, and without mi≈øtaking.</p>

And when both the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were joyned and made but one camp, they took up the room of two ≈øquares. Sometimes both camps were near each other, but ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Polybius</hi> hath omitted the number of the gates of the camps, and their names, and where they were placed, how the enclo≈øure of the camp was made, the lodgings for the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> two <hi>Lieutenants</hi> (one for each Legion) of the <hi>Que≈øtor</hi> (who was their <hi>Trea≈øurer</hi>) of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of the camp (who was the fi≈øcall or mar≈øhall judge) of the twelve <hi>Prefects</hi> of the Allies, of the victuall, the arms, and the engines for war, of the apparel, and what the tents were made of; which (with the help of ≈øome authours, and according to probabilitie) we will here ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt we find in ≈øeverall hi≈øtories that the camp had foure gates, placed and called as is ≈øhewed in the foregoing figure.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the enclo≈øure of the camp, we reade al≈øo that they made the rampart of the earth which they took out of the moat; and to make the earth hold together they planted two or three rows of ≈øtakes, about which they enterlaced bru≈øh-wood, after the manner of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</p>
                     <p>For the lodgings of the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> Lieutenants, it is probable that they were lodged about the <hi>Praetorium.</hi>

                     <p>BE≈øides the oath which was required of the ≈øouldiers after their election, they were made to take another in the camp, namely not to ≈øteal any thing, and if they found any thing to carry it to the <hi>Tribunes. Polybius</hi> reporteth that it was thus done between the hands of the <hi>Tribunes;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> ≈øaith that they did it at the beginning of the election of ≈øouldiers between the hands of the <hi>Con≈øul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That done, they divided the <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Ha≈øtati</hi> as followeth: two to take care to keep clean the great ≈øtreet which was between the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and the re≈øt of the ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and to ca≈øt water on it in ≈øummer, to avoid the di≈øcommoditie of du≈øt; for that was a place where every day a great part of the armie met: The other eighteen were divided to ≈øerve the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> namely three for every <hi>Tribune;</hi> of which they took every day eight ≈øouldiers for the guard of their lodging. The <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Triarii</hi> made the guard for the <hi>Cavalrie;</hi> and one <hi>Cohort</hi> every day kept the guard before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuls</hi> lodging.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7521:48"/>The moats and the ramparts were made on the one ≈øide by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and on the other ≈øide by the Allies. The <hi>Centurions</hi> made the ≈øouldiers to work at them, and two <hi>Tribunes</hi> had the charge to ≈øee the work well done.</p>
                     <p>The authoritie of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> in the camp was very great, and two of them together exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed it over their Legion for two moneths, after each other ≈øucce≈ø≈øively.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Word; a ≈øouldier of the la≈øt <hi>Cohort</hi> of the Infantery, or of the la≈øt <hi>Turm</hi> of Cavalrie, was to come to the <hi>Tribunes</hi> lodging, and there to take it upon a writing-tablet, where al≈øo was written the name of the ≈øouldier which took it, and the place of his lodging; and this he delivered before witne≈ø≈øes to the commander of his troup: That officer delivered it to the commander next him; and ≈øo the tablet was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from hand to hand to the fir≈øt <hi>Cohort</hi> near to the <hi>Tribune,</hi> to whom it was brought back before night, ≈øo that by this means he was a≈ø≈øured that all the armie had the word. And if any tablet were wanting of being brought back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it was ea≈øie to find where it had failed. It mu≈øt be ob≈øerved that here onely one <hi>Tribune</hi> is mentioned; which cau≈øeth me to believe that the two <hi>Tribunes</hi> which had the authority for two moneths time did agree to command every day by turns. Concerning the guard, it was kept day and night: and the foure and twentie houres were divided into eight watches.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt the <hi>Con≈øul</hi> was guarded by his ordinary <hi>Cohort;</hi> then every body made their guard round about his lodging; and be≈øides there were three guards kept, one at the <hi>Que≈øtors</hi> lodging, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7521:48"/>
the two other at the lodgings of the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> two <hi>Lieutenants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tergiductours</hi> or Rear-commanders order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guards, which drew by lot which ≈øhould begin fir≈øt: and they which were to begin were led to the <hi>Tribune</hi> which then commanded, who gave them the order of the guard, and (be≈øides that) a little tablet with a mark; and all the guards were ≈øet after the ≈øame manner. The rounds were made by the Cavalrie, whereof the chief officer commanded foure for the day and foure for the night: the fir≈øt went and took their orders from the <hi>Tribune,</hi> who gave them in writing what guards they were to vi≈øit.</p>
                     <p>The relieving and vi≈øiting of the guards was done eight times in foure and twentie houres, at the ≈øound of the trumpet, and the fir≈øt <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Triarii</hi> had the charge to cau≈øe them to march when occa≈øion ≈øerved.</p>
                     <p>When the trumpet gave them warning, the foure forementioned ≈øouldiers drew lots, and he to whom it fell to begin, took ≈øome of his friends with him, and if in going the round he found the guards in good order, he onely took from them the mark which the <hi>Tribune</hi> had given them, and carried it him back again next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But if he found the guard abandoned, or any ≈øentinels a≈øleep, or any other di≈øorder, he made his report thereof to the <hi>Tribune</hi> with his witne≈ø≈øes: and pre≈øently a councel was called to prove the offen≈øe and to puni≈øh the delinquent according to his de≈øert.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Velites</hi> made the guard round about the retrenchment, on the out≈øide and in≈øide of it, and at the gates. The Allies had the ≈øame order.</p>

                     <p>NOne but the <hi>Con≈øul</hi> could condemne any to death, and he had this authoritie as well over the principall commanders of the army as over the meane≈øt ≈øouldiers thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> admini≈øtred military ju≈øtice, which was rigourou≈øly practiced. The manner of their ordinary puni≈øhing was thus,</p>
                     <p>So ≈øoon as the <hi>Tribune</hi> had touched the partie condemned with a ≈øtaff or a rod, every ≈øouldier laid on upon him with cudgels, or battered him with ≈øtones, and oftentimes before he could get out of the camp he was killed: but yet if he e≈øcaped, he was not received into his countrey again, and none of his kindred dur≈øt give him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinment.</p>
                     <p>He that oppo≈øed or neglected the orders gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the guard, or for the rounds, or other ≈øervice concerning the ≈øecuritie of the camp; or fal≈øely pretended to have done ≈øome ≈øignall act; or had for≈øaken the place where he had been placed; or had lo≈øt his arms in the battel; or had ≈øtolen any thing in the camp; or born fal≈øe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; or el≈øe had for≈øaken his en≈øigne, was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed after this manner; as al≈øo he which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ≈ømaller faults thrice.</p>
                     <p>If it happened that many Legions or one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or a gro≈ø≈øe troup had run away, they were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7521:49"/>
puni≈øhed two wayes: the more rigourous way was to make them all draw lots, and to puni≈øh every tenth man; or more or fewer according to the exigence of the cau≈øe: by this means all were partakers of the fear, and a ≈ømall number of them were puni≈øhed. The more gentle way was, to cau≈øe them to lodge without the camp, and to give them barley in ≈øtead of wheat, which was a mark of ignominie; which many troups have wiped out by performing valourous and memorable acts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning their rewards, they excited tho≈øe ≈øouldiers by honourable acknowledgements and publick commendations in pre≈øence of all the re≈øt, which had performed ≈øome valourous and extraordinary act. Be≈øides that, to him that had wounded an enemy in ≈øome light skirmi≈øh, or that voluntarily had gone and a≈ø≈øaulted him, they gave a dart: To him which had killed and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed him (if he were one that ≈øerved on foot) they gave a target: if he were a hor≈øeman, a hor≈øe-furniture.</p>
                     <p>To him that (at the a≈ø≈øault of a town) was fir≈øt got up upon the wall, they gave a crown, which they called <hi>Muralis:</hi> to him which had re≈øcued a <hi>Romane</hi> citizen, a crown called <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vica,</hi> which was ≈øet upon his head by him which was ≈øo re≈øcued, whom he re≈øpected and honoured all his life after as his father.</p>
                     <p>The commanders had al≈øo their ≈øhares of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by the ≈øeverall triumphs which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, according to the greatne≈ø≈øe of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the felicitie of their victories.</p>

                     <p>COncerning their pay; It began not untill three hundred fourty eight years after the foundation of <hi>Rome:</hi> before that every ≈øouldier armed and victualled him≈øelf at his own charge, which was no hard thing in tho≈øe times, becau≈øe their warre was then extended no further then <hi>Rome:</hi> But when they began to go out of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was nece≈ø≈øary to give them pay, which at the beginning was very ≈ømall: afterwards it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed as the <hi>Romane</hi> empire grew in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. I will not trouble my ≈øelf to make the valuation of it according to our money, it being a thing of no utility: onely I will ≈øay, that the ≈øouldiers pay mu≈øt be ≈øo proportioned as he may maintein him≈øelf well thereby. I will further ob≈øerve here, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> charged them≈øelves with the furni≈øhing of bread, apparel, arms, and tents for all their ≈øouldiers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, barley for the hor≈øemens hor≈øes (abating the≈øe things out of their pay) which I find to be a good order, and above all things nece≈ø≈øary to make an army ≈øub≈øi≈øt: for be≈øides that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of ≈øouldiers are bad husbands, and ≈øuch (as if a care be not taken) will never be well clothed nor well fed, it is impo≈ø≈øible that a ≈øouldier ≈øhould everywhere find bread to be bought, and that he ≈øhould carry all things with him which he ≈øtandeth in need of.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of their order of battalia.</head>
                     <p>THere is a diver≈øitie of opinions about the order of battel of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Some would have it that when the <hi>Ha≈øtati</hi> be not able to ≈øus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the enemies charge, in their retreat they ≈øhould fall into the order of the <hi>Principes</hi> by files; and both they into the order of the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and ≈øo to renew the fight three times. Others will have it to be done by troups, whereof I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is much the greater probability, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fir≈øt way not onely impo≈ø≈øible to be put in practice but al≈øo mo≈øt dangerous, &amp; the other exceeding fei≈øible and profitable. For to fall one into another in that maner by files, the <hi>Ha≈øtati</hi> mu≈øt then fight at ≈øo wide a di≈øtance, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two files they might receive two other files, which ≈øheweth the weakne≈ø≈øe of this fir≈øt order, which being ≈øo ranged in battalia could not be able to repul≈øe nor ≈øu≈øtein the adver≈øe battallion. And even the files, being at ≈øo wide a di≈øtance from each other, were not able to keep them≈øelves right in fight nor to ob≈øerve their di≈øtances; but in the other way there are many conveniences to be found. Fir≈øt many bodies of a hundred and twenty men apiece (or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts) a≈ø≈øaulting a battallion, they may very well defeat it; at the wor≈øt they may retreat without di≈øordering them≈øelves or loo≈øing their di≈øtances. And the ≈øecond order, which is embattelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the fir≈øt, ju≈øt over again≈øt their intervalls, may ea≈øily fill them: as al≈øo (in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity) the third body may ≈øupply tho≈øe di≈øtances which are re≈øerved for them, renewing the fight three
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7521:51"/>
times. And that which confirmeth us the more in this opinion is, that in rea≈øon it ought to be ≈øo: next, the de≈øcription of the battel of <hi>Zama</hi> which <hi>Scipio</hi> fought again≈øt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> where it is ≈øaid that <hi>Scipio</hi> to hinder <hi>Hannibals</hi> elephants from routing his ≈øouldiers, cau≈øed the <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Principes</hi> (which were placed ju≈øt over again≈øt the intervalls of the <hi>Ha≈øtati</hi>) to ≈øtand ju≈øt behind them, ≈øo to leave ≈øtreets for the pa≈ø≈øage of the elephants: which ≈øheweth plainly that the order of battalia was di≈øpo≈øed by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,</hi> and not by files.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øpeak not of the <hi>Velites</hi> in this order of battalia, nor of all other light-armed ≈øouldiers, becau≈øe they fought not but with ca≈øting-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and afar off, and when the armies approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the ≈øhock, they retired them≈øelves behind the heavie-armed.</p>
                     <p>Now to form the ≈øaid order, I will ≈øay that the file was alwayes of ten men in depth; that a Cohort or Maniple of a Legion of foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand two hundred men con≈øi≈øted alwayes of one hundred and twentie ≈øouldiers, and con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cohort made ten ranks and twelve files, conteining (at ≈øix foot ≈øquare of ground for every ≈øouldier) ≈øeventy two foot in breadth and ≈øixty in depth: and the moity of it when they were at three foot di≈øtance.</p>

                     <p>NO <hi>Romane</hi> Commander hath made braver ≈øieges then <hi>Ce≈øar,</hi> nor de≈øcribed them more perfectly. He hath left examples for the a≈ø≈øail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all ≈øorts of ≈øites, and to maintein a ≈øiege again≈øt all kinds of reliefs. At <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øium,</hi> which is upon the ≈øea, he con≈øtrained <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> to abandon it, for that he ≈øhut up the haven by which that town was to be relieved. At <hi>Cadenac,</hi> which was a ≈øite inexpugnable, he con≈øtrained the garri≈øon to yield it, by taking away their water. At <hi>Alexia,</hi> where were 80000 ≈øouldiers within the town, and which expected two or three times as many, he ≈øo forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him≈øelf before it, both again≈øt the town and again≈øt the enemy without, as he fami≈øhed it. And at <hi>Bourges</hi> and <hi>Mar≈øeilles</hi> he took the fir≈øt by a≈ø≈øault, and con≈øtrained the other to yield, when it was upon the point of being taken by a≈ø≈øault. I will not here particularize the engines
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7521:53"/>
which they then made u≈øe of to force places of ≈øtrength, becau≈øe the cannon hath taken away the u≈øe of them. Yet I will onely ≈øay that they approched to the walls by degrees, as much ≈øheltred as they could, and then attempted to batter them down by their engines, or by mines to force an a≈ø≈øault, or at lea≈øt to lodge upon the breach: which I the rather ≈øpeak, to ≈øhew that how≈øoever we have changed the manner of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, the better to make re≈øi≈øtance again≈øt our new thundring engines, neverthele≈ø≈øe the ancient maximes for the taking of towns are the ≈øame, which we make u≈øe of at this day.

And all the≈øe great works and circumvallations which we admire, and by the help of which they have taken many great cities in ≈øight of greater armies then their own, which have not been able to relieve them, are nothing in compari≈øon of tho≈øe which <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> made at this ≈øiege of <hi>Alexia.</hi> To conclude, they which come neare≈øt to the manner of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> as well in ≈øieges as in the field, are they which prove the mo≈øt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commanders.</p>

we mu≈øt yet ob≈øerve two principall cau≈øes, which their mo≈øt excellent Commanders have ≈øucce≈ø≈øefully ob≈øerved to obtein victories in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: namely, to ≈øtrive to overwing their enemy, and never to cau≈øe their army to fight all at once. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to keep him≈øelf from being overwinged in the battel which he fought again≈øt <hi>Cre≈øus,</hi> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the front of his army by as many more as they were, by making the files of his infantery but 12 deep, which before were 24: and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo≈øe his enemy, he placed his be≈øt men on the wings; who having defeated the wings of the adver≈øe army, came to a≈ø≈øault the body of the battel on their flanks and on their rear. At the battel of <hi>Cannae Hannibal</hi> placed all his be≈øt ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on the wings, and the meaner ones in the middle, that ≈øo the <hi>Romanes</hi> finding but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance there, might in≈øen≈øibly ≈øink into them, and by that means they found them≈øelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo≈øed on both flanks. At the battel of <hi>Phar≈øale, Ce≈øar</hi> ≈øheltred one of the flanks of his army by a little river, and fortified his Cavalry (which was on his other flank) by a body of Infantery, to re≈øi≈øt <hi>Pompey's</hi> hor≈øe, which exceeded his own by much; ≈øo that having routed it by this means, he a≈ø≈øailed the army on the flank, and ea≈øily defeated it. At the battel of <hi>Zama Hannibal</hi> made a body of all his old companies of <hi>Italy,</hi> which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from all his army, that ≈øo when all the re≈øt (as well of the one part as the other) ≈øhould be weary with fighting, this body being fre≈øh, might carry away the victory. So that <hi>Scipio,</hi> after that he had defeated all that were before him, found him≈øelf a≈øtoni≈øhed to ≈øee a ≈øecond army for him to fight with afre≈øh.</p>

                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:7521:54"/>Here may be an objection made, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might be ≈øo unequall in number, as all the≈øe maximes might prove unprofitable; whereunto I an≈øwer, that when an army pa≈ø≈øeth a certain number of fourty or fifty thou≈øand men, the ≈øurplu≈ø≈øage ≈øerveth for no other end but to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh the army: for it is an ea≈øie thing by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching to avoid battel.

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> A comparing of the arms and military orders of the Romanes with tho≈øe of the Grecians.</head>
                     <p>THe arms of the <hi>Grecians</hi> were the buckler, the pike, and the ≈øword. Their order was of great bodies of battalions of 16 deep of the heavie-armed, and then ≈øtrengthened by eight in depth of the light-armed: ≈øo that the battalions came to be 24 in depth, and fought all at once, making all one front.</p>
                     <p>The arms of the <hi>Romanes</hi> were the target and the ≈øword; their order was to make ≈ømall bodies
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7521:54"/>
of 150 or 200 ≈øouldiers at the mo≈øt, which were onely ten in depth, and to make three orders of battalia, that ≈øo they might fight three times, one after another.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the arms of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> it ≈øeemeth that their long pikes had a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Romane</hi> targets, becau≈øe they reached farre; and even at this day we find no weapon comparable to the pike again≈øt the violence of the hor≈øe: and for their order, tho≈øe great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies met with nothing that could re≈øi≈øt them. On the other ≈øide tho≈øe great <hi>Romane</hi> targets co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ≈øouldiers ≈øo well as the pikes could not hurt them; and if once they came to joyn, they made a great ≈ølaughter with their ≈øhort &amp; broad ≈øwords; for then the pike was unu≈øefull. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, their ≈ømall troups gave them this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that they brought more hands to fight at once. Concerning their di≈øpo≈øing of their three orders one behind another, to the end they might relieve each other, and to be able to begin the fight again by all three, they had this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, that all were not wearied nor di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at once. In ≈øo much that oftentimes they have carried away the victory after the defeat of their two fir≈øt orders: for that their third order being fre≈øh, and having rallied all the re≈øt, gave the la≈øt charge again≈øt an army which was tired and in di≈øorder, and ≈øo gained the battel.</p>
                     <p>There be two di≈øcommodities more in tho≈øe great bodies; namely, that they mu≈øt ever have a very ≈ømooth field for the battel, el≈øe they are not able to keep their order; and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agitate on the right or left, but onely fight ju≈øt before them. But the ≈ømall troups weild
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7521:55"/>
them≈øelves on all ≈øides, and continue their order in all places. It is true that the <hi>Romanes</hi> ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times joyned all their forces together, making but one body of all their army, in an Orb; but this was but to ≈øave them≈øelves in a retreat, and not to charge an enemy: for as the≈øe great bodies are as it were unmoveable and of little u≈øe in a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaults; ≈øo when they will onely defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, they are hard to be broken.</p>
                     <p>And yet they u≈øed not this la≈øt order bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> when they were per≈øecuted by the arrows of a great Cavalrie, as that of the <hi>Parthians:</hi> for not being able to come to hand-blows with them, they were con≈øtrained to put them≈øelves into this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to ≈øhelter them≈øelves with their targets. So that I conclude that the arms and orders of the <hi>Romanes</hi> were better then tho≈øe of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> becau≈øe ≈ømall troups accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves better to all ≈øites then great ones, and fighting at ≈øeverall times they continue the fight with more ob≈øtinacie then when all fight at once; and that it is more ea≈øie of many ≈ømall troups to make a gro≈ø≈øe readily and without di≈øorder, then of a gro≈ø≈øe to make many ≈ømall troups.</p>

of all the States of our time, may choo≈øe them, and take ≈øuch as ≈øhe plea≈øeth. Whereupon we mu≈øt con≈øider the con≈øtitution of the≈øe States, on what maximes they be founded, and what either of them may be≈øt do to have good ≈øouldiers. The greater part of States at this time are more found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon policie then upon warre, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour rather to con≈øerve them≈øelves then to grow greater. Wherefore we ≈øee that learning flouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there, and arms degenerate; in ≈øo much that tho≈øe States which are founded upon warre do devour the other.</p>
                     <p>The example of the <hi>Turk</hi> to the ≈øhame of the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> and that of the king of <hi>Spain</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are two manife≈øt proofs. That which cau≈øeth this mi≈øchief is, that men of the gown have po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves of the government of almo≈øt all States, which (for that they hate ≈øouldiers) cau≈øe them alwayes to be ill dealt with, and do advi≈øe Princes to imploy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliars rather then their naturall ≈øubjects: which is a mo≈øt pernicious maxime. But this being no fit place to treat of it, we will onely ≈øpeak of the election of ≈øouldiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England,</hi> which hath right by the laws of that kingdome to make choice of her ≈øouldiers, may ob≈øerve the form of the election of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which is very good. The other kingdomes which have not that power mu≈øt incite their men which are ambitious of honour to cau≈øe them≈øelves to be enrolled, a≈øwell for the hope of being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to other honours by embracing the profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of warre, as by ≈øhutting up the means of atteining thereunto by any other way then that<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:7521:57"/>
For example, not to be≈øtow any office of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor of the kings hou≈øe, nor any charge among≈øt the ≈øouldiers, to any but ≈øuch, as have ≈øerved in the warres a certain number of years; nor to make any man Colonel of hor≈øe which hath not been a Captain and other officer of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie; nor any to be Mar≈øhall of the field, which hath not honourably born le≈ø≈øer charges; nor any to be Generall of the army, which hath not been a worthy Mar≈øhall of the field: briefly, that none may be advanced to any office, which hath not pa≈ø≈øed through the degrees of warre. And as the hope of advancement is a ≈øtrong ≈øpur to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage every man to exerci≈øe the profe≈ø≈øion of arms; ≈øo the fear of finding ones ≈øelf poore and needy after long ≈øervice is a ≈øharp bit to keep men from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

VVhence I conclude, that the be≈øt means to have good ≈øouldiers is to choo≈øe ≈øuch as are mo≈øt fit for warre; the ≈øecond, to incite men of ambition and vertue freely to enroll them≈øelves, by ≈øhutting the doore of any other way to advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and la≈øtly, to entertein a body of an armie<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and to be carefull (as well in peace as in warre) to keep them under an exact di≈øcipline, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation One of which three wayes all ≈øorts of States may make u≈øe of.</p>

Cavalrie, for that many of them joyned together make a very ≈øolid body, and very hard to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on their front, by rea≈øon of their length, whereof foure or five ranks extend the heads of their pikes beyond the fir≈øt rank of men, and do alwayes keep out the ≈øquadrons of hor≈øe from them twelve or fifteen foot of. <hi>Maurice Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> had a great de≈øire to make u≈øe of the target, and having cau≈øed divers trials to be made thereof, hath found that it hath not onely re≈øi≈øted the pike, but that half the number of targets hath alwayes entred into twice the number of pikes, and hath routed them. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, being but Generall of the armies of a State, and not a ≈øove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne and ab≈øolute Prince, he dur≈øt not make ≈øo great a change; whether it were that he feared the Cavalrie, which now-adayes is exceeding well armed or el≈øe the reproch of ≈øome evil ≈øucce≈ø≈øe; not being ignorant that the people Judge of the actions of ≈øuch as ≈øerve them rather by the event then by rea≈øon. For my part, I would adde this kind of arms to our di≈øcipline, making alwayes the principall body of my Infantery to be of pikes, and to have for every battallion a ≈ømall body ≈øeparate of one hundred or one hundred and twentie tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to charge on the flank, which would work a marvellous effect on the day of battel; and this ≈øhould be the true place of voluntiers, and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brave Nobilitie, which often prove to be but trouble≈øome to an army. Concerning the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive arms of the Cavalrie, there be of five ≈øorts; namely, the lance, the pi≈øtoll, the ≈øword, the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and the musket: the two fir≈øt are given to the heavie-armed calvarie, which mu≈øt have for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7521:59"/>
defen≈øive arms the cuiracecask, vambraces, ta≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øets, cui≈ø≈øes, and guard-rein, and (not many years ≈øince) ≈øome hor≈øes have been armed with barbs. Of the two other kinds, they which ≈øerve with carabines have the head-piece and cuirace; and becau≈øe they fight on hor≈øeback, they mu≈øt be well mounted: but they which ≈øerve with the musket have no defen≈øive arms. Of the≈øe five ≈øorts of offen≈øive arms there be but three much in u≈øe; namely, the pi≈øtol, ≈øword, and carabine. The Spaniards onely have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ≈øome few companies of lances, which they keep rather for gravitie then rea≈øon; for the lance doth no effect but by the violence of the carreir of the hor≈øe, and be≈øides there is but one rank which can make u≈øe of it; ≈øo that their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mu≈øt be to fight by ≈øingle ranks, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not re≈øi≈øt the ≈øquadrons: and if they ≈øhould fight in ≈øquadrons, they would rather be trouble≈øome then ≈øerviceable. And for musketiers on hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back or dragones, they are al≈øo in a manner left off, for that in the civil warres they ruined the Infantery, every man de≈øiring to have a nag, that ≈øo he might be the fitter to rob and pillage: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈ø≈øe ≈øome well-ordered troups of this kind in an armie are of very great ≈øervice; either for executions, to gain bad pa≈ø≈øages, to guard the quarters of hor≈øe, or el≈øe (on a day of battel) to cau≈øe them to di≈ømount as forlorn hopes before the ≈øquadrons of Cavalrie.</p>
                     <p>Now the Cavalrie mu≈øt be proportioned with the Infantery; which may be di≈øtingui≈øhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ≈øituation of the countrey where the warre is made, or el≈øe according to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my again≈øt whom you are to fight. For if you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7521:59"/>
you be in a champain full of forrage, and if ye be to make warre again≈øt a great Cavalrie, as that of the <hi>Turk,</hi> in ≈øuch a ca≈øe you mu≈øt fortifie your ≈øelf with the greater number of hor≈øe. But if the warre be in a countrey enclo≈øed, either by mountains, forre≈øts, moores, or hedges and ditches, and that hath many fortified places, for that the warre is rather reduced to ≈øieges then to battels and field-combats, in ≈øuch a ca≈øe you mu≈øt ≈øtrengthen your Infanterie. And the≈øe two bodies are ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary the one for the other, as an armie cannot be held to be good nor ≈øub≈øi≈øt unle≈ø≈øe it be equally provided of both. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe, if I were not induced by ≈øome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rea≈øon, I would make the proportion of my army for the open countrey of a fourth part of hor≈øe to three fourth parts of Infantery; as to twentie foure thou≈øand foot, eight thou≈øand hor≈øe: in an inclo≈øed countrey, of a ≈øixth part of hor≈øe to five parts of foot; as to twentie foure thou≈øand foot, foure thou≈øand hor≈øe. It remaineth to give to the≈øe two bodies ≈øuch arms as were before mentioned with the mo≈øt profitable proportion. The <hi>Swi≈ø≈øes</hi> have many more pikes then muskets, and for this they have made them≈øelves to be much feared in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain countrey; for in a day of battel where you come to hand, the number of pikes hath much advantage of that of muskets. Other nations do equally divide the pikes and muskets; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the war in the≈øe times is reduced to ≈øieges rather then battels, we de≈øire to have a greater number of muskets then of pikes. For my ≈øelf, which adde the targets to them, my opinion ≈øhould be to have the regiments of 1440 ≈øouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7521:60"/>
namely of 600 pikes, 600 muskets, and 240 targets. For the Cavalrie; I would proportion it after this manner: I would compo≈øe the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of 500 hor≈øe, whereof I would arm 400 with Cuira≈ø≈øiers arms; 50 with carabines, and 50 to be dragones.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, to provide good arms for your ≈øouldiers, unle≈ø≈øe you oblige them to wear them; it being an un≈øufferable ≈øhame to ≈øee their delicatene≈ø≈øe in the≈øe times, and how they di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øteem them: and to cover this fault, they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh that it is want of courage to go armed, and that they will go in their doublets into the mo≈øt dangerous places, a≈øwell as they which are arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is not enough to go into a place to cau≈øe ones ≈øelf there to be knocked on the head; we ≈øhould go thither to conquer, and not to be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Be≈øides this inconvenience groweth of it, that if you u≈øe not your ≈øelf to wear your arms, you are ≈øo pe≈øtered with them as you cannot fight in them: on the contrary, if you accu≈øtome your ≈øelf to them, they are no more trouble≈øome to you, and you are at as much libertie in them as if you were in your doublet. But the greate≈øt mi≈øchief that cometh of it is, that the ruine of military di≈øcipline followeth on it; which a good Captain ought to cau≈øe to be exactly ob≈øerved in every part. For if he ≈ølacken it in one, or in favour of ≈øome per≈øons, the con≈øequences which follow on it by little and little will be ≈øuch as they will wholly overthrow it: and then he ≈øhall find him≈øelf without obedience and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect; which he ≈øhall never recover without incurring the hatred of tho≈øe whom he hath too much ≈øpared; it being mo≈øt certain that it is

ea≈øier to prevent a mi≈øchief then to help it when it is befallen.</p>

                     <p>BE≈øides that which hath been ≈øaid to incite every one to take upon him the profe≈ø≈øion of arms rather then any other, we mu≈øt make other ob≈øervations to make a man worthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which con≈øi≈øt in three things: namely in the recompen≈øe of commendable actions, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of bad ones, and in the continuall and exact exerci≈øe of militarie di≈øcipline; for there is no profe≈ø≈øion in the world which hath more need of ≈øuch helps then that of warre, where for the ≈øingle pay (which hardly affordeth livelyhood, and with which the meane≈øt arti≈øan would not be contented) the ≈øouldier abandoneth him≈øelf to all ≈øorts of perils and labours: but none are in≈øtigated thereunto unle≈ø≈øe it be by emulation of honour, or by licence to do evil; and as the fir≈øt aim is vertuous, ≈øo you ≈øhall have good ≈øervice of ≈øuch as enter into it for that end. But of the other you ≈øhall reap nothing but ≈øhame; for in ≈øtead of a good and obedient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my you ≈øhall find that you have no better then a troup of pillaging rogues, which without order or obedience for≈øake you, either after a good boot-haling, or in any eminent danger. For this rea≈øon the election of ≈øouldiers is a better way of forming an army, then onely to receive voluntaries; where all the vagabonds and evil livers, and ≈øuch as cannot live but by robbing, cau≈øe them≈øelves to be enrolled. Therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7521:61"/>
≈øuch as are vertuous to well-doing, and to deterre the vitious from doing evil, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and puni≈øhments are principally nece≈ø≈øary. The <hi>Romanes</hi> have made very profitable u≈øe of the≈øe two means: and if we follow not their way we ≈øhall never have good nor well-di≈øcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ≈øouldiers. It matters not though we u≈øe not the very ≈øame remunerations and the ≈øame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments they did; it ≈øufficeth that they be equivalent, that ≈øo we may receive the ≈øame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them: and the≈øe things are diver≈øly done, according to time and cu≈øtome. The principall is to be an exact ob≈øerver of them, that ≈øo the remunerations may excite brave men to worthy actions, and the rigour of puni≈øhment may keep cowards from doing ba≈øely. The manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimating the ≈øouldiers which the <hi>Romanes</hi> had, is held to be cruel: neverthele≈ø≈øe there be ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ≈øo infamous actions committed, as you are con≈øtrained to u≈øe great ≈øeverity, to give a terrour to all; finding it very good to ≈øtrike a fear into all tho≈øe that have e≈øcaped by the means of the lot, and to put but few to death. For you mu≈øt imprint this belief into your ≈øouldiers, that by ba≈øe flight they e≈øcape not death, but they onely exchange a glorious death which they ≈øhould have acquired by fighting valiantly for an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one. After that the ≈øouldier be incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the honour of being e≈øteemed valiant, and brought to a hatred of being held a coward, it mu≈øt be made a like degree of honour for every one to know how well to obey his ≈øuperiour, from the private ≈øouldier to the Lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: for on this obedience all the functions of an army depend, and without it you can keep no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7521:61"/>
in rule, nor do any thing that is good. This mu≈øt be ingraffed into the hearts of the ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as being one of the principalle≈øt vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in them. From hence groweth order; by this military exerci≈øe is mainteined; briefly, by this brave de≈øignes are executed, and without this all goeth to confu≈øion and ruine. I will not trouble my ≈øelf here to ≈øpeak of the particular military exerci≈øes which the ≈øouldier is to be exerci≈øed in, becau≈øe divers books are ful of them, and that cu≈øtome doth alwaies change ≈øomething or other in them. I will onely ≈øay that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ≈øo profitable as to exerci≈øe every ≈øouldier to carry his arms properly, to u≈øe them ≈øouldier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to keep his rank well, and therein well to execute all the motions and charges which are commanded him. So much concerning the ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: But concerning the recompen≈øe of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of armies, I will ≈øay the ≈øame which I ≈øaid for the ≈øouldiers, namely, that according to the time, or the con≈øtitution of kingdomes or common-wealths, ≈øuch cour≈øes ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as the honour of ≈øuch as have done brave actions and great ≈øervices be not dimini≈øhed nor blemi≈øhed: For that the mo≈øt generous ≈øpirits (which will ea≈øily excu≈øe all want of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compen≈øe for their ≈øervices) will never endure to be robbed of the honour due to their brave actions, and will ≈øooner ≈øtomach ≈øuch a want of due honour then any other thing what≈øoever: whereupon very often great mi≈øchiefs have followed.</p>

                     <p>NOw as the Generall of the armie requireth of the ≈øouldiers that obedience which is due to him, ≈øo he mu≈øt have a care to give them no ju≈øt cau≈øe to exempt them≈øelves from it: to this end he ought to keep them in continuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for that idlene≈ø≈øe engendreth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners and di≈øcipline, whence proceed luxury, neglecting of exerci≈øes and the guards, and di≈øobedience to ≈øuperiours. It was the ea≈øe and idlene≈ø≈øe of <hi>Capua</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed <hi>Hannibals</hi> army, and the delicacies of <hi>Babylon</hi> which corrupted <hi>Alexander</hi> him≈øelf, and from whence he drew away his army to prevent the totall ruine of it; there being no means of greater efficacy to keep it in due order, and to prevent ≈øeditions, then to imploy it in warre. It is therefore a maxime which mu≈øt be exactly ob≈øerved, never to ≈øuffer your ≈øouldiers in any place to be idle, e≈øpecially when the army is brought together in a body; for if you imploy them not in that which is good, they will bu≈øie them≈øelves in that which is naught. This cour≈øe mu≈øt be taken a≈øwell in the time of ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt peace as of open warre; particularly, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe them to u≈øe their arms well, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve good order; and though there be no need, yet to u≈øe them to make retrenchments of the camp, and to make their huts: that ≈øo they may be ≈øo accu≈øtomed to remove the earth, that when nece≈ø≈øity ≈øhall require, it may be no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them. I would further imploy them to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7521:62"/>
make fortifications and other works of this kind, not onely to keep them in exerci≈øe, but that al≈øo they may get (be≈øides their pay) wherewith the better to maintein them≈øelves, and that they accu≈øtome them≈øelves to that which in time of warre is as profitable to them as to fight well, there being nothing impo≈ø≈øible for twenty or thirty thou≈øand men which will work in the earth; for in eight dayes they will make fortre≈ø≈øes which ≈øhall be impregnable: And <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> hath made him≈øelf as much redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admired by the great works which he hath cau≈øed his ≈øouldiers to make, as by his great battels. Moreover, the Generall mu≈øt take care that they be well clothed and well fed; e≈øpecially that (out of their payes) they be furni≈øhed with clothes and ≈øhoes, otherwi≈øe he will ≈øoon find his army to decay, and di≈øea≈øes to rage in it for want thereof. He mu≈øt al≈øo have a great care of tho≈øe which are ≈øick and hurt, and therein to ≈øpare for no co≈øt; that ≈øo the ≈øouldiers may not excu≈øe them≈øelves from going on upon dangerous ≈øervices, or to undergo laborious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, becau≈øe they are abandoned when they are ≈øick or wounded. The General ought al≈øo to take a particular care not to overlabour his ≈øouldiers, nor to put them to extraordinary hard marches without great nece≈ø≈øity: but when need requireth it, he mu≈øt be the fir≈øt to undergo the labour; for the example of the commander maketh all things ea≈øie to the ≈øouldier. The examples not onely of the greate≈øt Captains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the Ancients, but even of the greate≈øt Monarchs and Emperours, ≈øhould ≈øhame our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Captains of the≈øe times, which are afraid

                     <p>THere are divers con≈øiderations to be made upon the marching of an army; which may be a≈ø≈øaulted in the day-time, or at its di≈ølodging, or even in the night when it is lodged. If it be not encamped, but lodge in villages, you mu≈øt (to cau≈øe it to meet in one body) give it a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vous on the way which it mu≈øt take; which if the enemy learn time enough to be there fir≈øt, or that he meet with it there by chance, he will put the army to run a great hazard, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to its Rendez-vous at divers times and by divers wayes. The be≈øt means to guard ones ≈øelf from ≈øuch an accident are, to keep your Rendez-vous very ≈øecret, to have good ≈øpies among≈øt the enemies, and to ≈øend out many di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers for intelligence. When you encamp you are not ≈øubject to that danger, becau≈øe the army is alwayes together. For the march you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7521:63"/>
mu≈øt con≈øider the countrey where you are, and the number of ≈øouldiers which you have. If you march in great plains, you may (for the mo≈øt part) march in battalia; or at lea≈øt with form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed battaillons and ≈øquadrons: then it is very ea≈øie to put your ≈øelf readily into a good form to fight well, becau≈øe you march not in a long order. But when you march through a ≈øtrait countrey, where but few can march in front, then you mu≈øt compute the di≈øcommodity of the way, and the time you have for your march, with the number of ≈øouldiers whereof your army con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for 10000 foot marching 10 in front, and 1000 hor≈øe marching 5 in front, with the lighte≈øt baggage they can po≈ø≈øibly have, and ten cannons, with equipage for every piece to ≈øhoot 100 bullets, take up about 28000 foot of way in length; whereby you may judge how much way in file 30000 foot and 6000 hor≈øe will take. Therefore when ≈øo great armies find them≈øelves in ≈øuch a trouble≈øome way, you mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity divide them into ≈øeverall bodies, which may march one after another, and lodge ≈øeverally; or rather cau≈øe them to march by divers wayes, ≈øome miles di≈øtant from each other; or how≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to make wayes through the fields for your ≈øouldiers to march in, leaving the great road for your cannon and baggage. If there be a river to pa≈ø≈øe where you can make but one bridge, or ≈øome pa≈ø≈øage over a mountain, moori≈øh ground, or forre≈øt where you cannot make ≈øeverall wayes, then you mu≈øt march one after another, and on ≈øeverall dayes. I trouble not my ≈øelf to ≈øhew how you are to pa≈ø≈øe through ≈øuch bad pa≈ø≈øages in view of the enemy, becau≈øe many

The time of lodging is al≈øo a dangerous time to be a≈ø≈øaulted in, becau≈øe the army is then tired, and every man (de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be lodged) ha≈øtneth to the quarter in di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which is a thing hard to avoid, if (before you enter your lodgings) you cau≈øe not your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ≈øtand in battalia, and ≈øo cau≈øe them to lodge troup after troup, without ≈øuffering any to lodge but by command, mean time ≈øending out on all ≈øides upon di≈øcovery.</p>

ofttimes you have not lei≈øure to put your ≈øelf in order to fight; therefore you mu≈øt be carefull to ≈øend out di≈øcoverers every night, by divers ≈ømall troups, which (if they do well perform their task) will not ≈øuffer you to be ≈øurpri≈øed; for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or a gro≈ø≈øe troup capable to a≈ø≈øail a quarter of an army cannot march ≈øo ≈øecretly that it be not perceived.

in our time <hi>Maurice Prince of Orange</hi> hath revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the u≈øe of them, or at lea≈øt hath given them a great perfection. The entrenchment of a camp a≈ø≈øureth an army, in that it is never di≈øper≈øed in the villages, where ≈øome quarter or other is ever in danger to be ≈øurpri≈øed, but lodgeth all in one body, and in ≈øuch fa≈øhion as being a≈ø≈øailed it may fight with great advantage. The entrenchment ≈øaveth a great deal of trouble, becau≈øe by it there is need of the fewer guards by many, &amp; tho≈øe le≈ø≈øe toil≈øome, e≈øpecially to the Cavalry, which when they are lodged in open villages, are con≈øtrained to be on hor≈øeback almo≈øt all night. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment enclo≈øeth your army as a walled city; from whence you may march privately with ≈øuch troups as you plea≈øe, to execute all ≈øorts of brave de≈øignes, leaving your baggage in ≈øafety. The entrenchment hindreth the enemy from con≈øtraining you to fight, unle≈ø≈øe when you plea≈øe. The entrenchment cau≈øeth you to be without danger at the head of the mo≈øt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full armies. The entrenchment cau≈øeth you to take ≈øtrong cities in the face of more pui≈ø≈øant armies then your own.

                     <p>OF all the actions of warre the mo≈øt glorious and mo≈øt important is to give battel: the gaining of one or two acquireth or ≈øubverteth whole Empires. Anciently all warres were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by battels, which cau≈øed ≈øuch ≈øpeedy conque≈øt: For the pre≈øent, warres are managed more fox-like then lion-like; and are rather founded upon ≈øieges then combats. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe, there be divers nations at this day which decide the mo≈øt part of their warres by battels, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Per≈øians:</hi> and even among≈øt the Chri≈øtians we have ≈øeen of late divers bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels given in <hi>Germanie,</hi> whereof onely one had almo≈øt inthralled all the Prote≈øtant Princes. And an army well-di≈øciplined, and which feareth not battel, hath a marvellous advantage in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignes of that which feareth it. For this rea≈øon (how≈øoever the manner of warring at this time be not ≈øo frequent in the hazarding of battels as in times pa≈øt) the knowledge of them mu≈øt not be neglected. And a Generall of an army can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øaid to be a good Captain, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all advantages which may be taken on a day of battel, and all di≈øadvantages which ought to be avoyded; that ≈øo he may well di≈øintangle him≈øelf. I will not ≈øpeak of du≈øt, the ≈øunne or rain, whereof it is ob≈øerved that many Captains have made u≈øe, driving them on the face of the enemy by gaining the wind of them; becau≈øe they are ca≈øuall things which may change in a

                     <p>He then that will give battel mu≈øt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ≈øeven principall things. The fir≈øt is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ≈øuffer him≈øelf to be forced to fight again≈øt his will. The ≈øecond, to choo≈øe a field for the battel fit for the quality and number of his ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: for if he feareth to be inclo≈øed by a great number, he mu≈øt ≈øhelter his flanks<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or at lea≈øt one of them, by the nature of the place; as by a river, wood, or ≈øome other thing equivalent: and if he be weak in his Cavalry, he mu≈øt avoid the plains; as he mu≈øt ≈øtrait pa≈ø≈øages or enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed places, if ≈øtronger. The third, ≈øo to range his army in battel, as according to the quality of his ≈øouldiers it may be within its own advantage, ≈øheltring his hor≈øe by his foot, if therein he be the weaker; and if the contrary, his foot by his hor≈øe; di≈øpo≈øing all his ≈øouldiers in ≈øuch order as they may fight divers times before they be wholly defeated: for if we well ob≈øerve the ≈ømall troups of ≈øouldiers which fight not all at once, and believe that a hundred hor≈øe in two troups wil beat two hundred in one entire troup, and have ob≈øerved in our times that divers bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels have been won by him which had made a troup of re≈øerve, which was not to fight untill all the re≈øt had fought, how much greater effect will a ≈øecond order of battel produce, which will come to the charge after that all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe army hath fought again≈øt the fir≈øt order<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and yet after that a third, in imitation of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> if the two former be defeated It is a maxime, That every troup (how gro≈ø≈øe ≈øoever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be) which hath fought, is in ≈øuch a di≈øorder as the lea≈øt troup that chargeth it, is able to defeat it ab≈øolutely: ≈øo that that Generall which can re≈øerve ≈øome troups to the la≈øt without fighting, will with tho≈øe bear away the victory: it being a long work and difficult to go about to rally an army that hath fought into good order to fight afre≈øh; ≈øome gazing about for pillage, others being vexed to return to the danger again, and all being ≈øo di≈øtracted as they do not or will not under≈øtand any command: on the contrary, ≈øuch as have not as yet fought, are under obedience, and ready to do what≈øoever their Generall ≈øhall command them. So that the knowledge of a Generall of an army is not ≈øo much to rally di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and defeated troups (which is properly but an action of courage) as to make his troups fight to good purpo≈øe, the one after the other, and not all at once: for he mu≈øt con≈øider that he cannot be well obeyed by his ≈øouldiers, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untill the houre that he ≈øendeth them to the combat. After that all the orations of the world will not ≈øtay them when they flie; but this troup which is in good order will ea≈øily do it. The fourth is, to have many good command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it being impo≈ø≈øible that a Generall ≈øhould ≈øuffice for all places. After that he hath made a good choice of his field for battel, and put his army into good order, it is altogether impo≈ø≈øible for him (when it cometh to blows) to give order, more then in that part where he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent: ≈øo that if he be not well a≈øsi≈øted every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where el≈øe, a≈øwell among≈øt the hor≈øe as foot, though he ≈øhould work miracles in that place where he him≈øelf is, he cannot make good the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7521:67"/>
ignorance of tho≈øe officers which command in the other parts of his army. Therefore there mu≈øt be at lea≈øt five principall commanders to make an army fight well, namely for three bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Infantery, di≈øtingui≈øhed by vanguard, battel, and rearguard, and two for the hor≈øe which are on the wings. The fifth is, ≈øo to ob≈øerve your di≈øtances in your order of battel, that the foremo≈øt troups being put to recoil, may not fall upon tho≈øe which ≈øhould come up to relieve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, nor the ≈øecond upon the third. The ≈øixth is, to place the mo≈øt valiant ≈øouldiers on the wings of the army, and to begin the battel by that wing which you think to be ≈øtronge≈øt; for if you once break one of the enemies wings, you fall upon his flank and rear, and it is impo≈ø≈øible for him to re≈øi≈øt you. The ≈øeventh and la≈øt is, not to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any to pur≈øue the enemy, nor fall to pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, untill he be routed on all parts; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be good to give him a hot chace, you mu≈øt ever have ≈øome troups in order, which mu≈øt not disband, that ≈øo you may avoid all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. I will not ≈øpeak of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which may be met with in a field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, whereof a good Captain often maketh u≈øe with great profit; becau≈øe there can no certain rule be given for it, by rea≈øon the diver≈øitie of ≈øituations is ≈øuch, that you ≈øhall never find two every-way alike.</p>

Now the be≈øt fortre≈ø≈øes again≈øt the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non are tho≈øe which are made of earth; becau≈øe (when they have a ≈øufficient thickne≈ø≈øe to make re≈øi≈øtance) they are not ≈øubject to endamage the be≈øieged, as tho≈øe fortifications are which are made of ma≈øons work, the ≈øhivers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do much mi≈øchief. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, when a Prince can be at the co≈øt to line them as high as the rampart, leaving the parapet upon it to be of earth cannon-proof, it maketh the work to la≈øt the longer.</p>
                     <p>In fortre≈ø≈øes you mu≈øt ob≈øerve foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall things: namely, that the line of defen≈øe be within musket-≈øhot; that the flanked angle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not ninety degrees, nor be le≈ø≈øe then ≈øixty; that the gorge of the bul-wark be not too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and that the flank be as great as may be. And
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7521:68"/>
the≈øe foure generall maximes mu≈øt be ≈øo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among≈øt them≈øelves, as that to make one of them exceeding good you de≈øtroy not the re≈øt. You mu≈øt al≈øo avoid tenailles in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall body of fortification, unle≈ø≈øe the ground be ≈øo ≈ømall as it will not ≈øuffer you to make good flanks. For the interior angle of ≈øuch a fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rai≈øed as it ought to be cannot be defended by any flank, and men may lodge them≈øelves at the foot of it without receiving any hurt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe it be by ≈øtones thrown over. This is the rea≈øon why tenailles are not u≈øed but in the counter≈øcarps. The moats are u≈øually propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned according to the earth nece≈ø≈øary to make the fortifications; and ≈øuch as are full of water are be≈øt to hinder a ≈øurpri≈øe, and the forts defend them≈øelves the be≈øt again≈øt an a≈ø≈øault: their breadth mu≈øt have a due proportion; for when they are too broad the out-works are too farre di≈øtant from the defen≈øe of the principall fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but depth never ≈øpoiled a moat. The fal≈øe brayes are joyned to the body of the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is anew invention and excellent to hinder the approching to the bulwarks by gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries. The counter≈øcarp, half-moons, ravelins, and horn-works are beyond the great moat; all the out-works (if it be po≈ø≈øible) mu≈øt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the body of the fortification. The≈øe are in gro≈ø≈øe the principall ob≈øervations which are in fortifications in a place which is levell and approchable: the re≈øt dependeth on the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Enginier, which mu≈øt make profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble u≈øe of the ≈øituation of the place which he is to fortifie, either in taking what ≈øerveth for his advantage, or in avoyding what≈øoever is to his

For the≈øe rea≈øons in enterpri≈øes made upon intelligence both the defendant and a≈ø≈øailant mu≈øt be very ≈øu≈øpicious and exceeding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to ob≈øerve the words, actions and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of ≈øuch as promi≈øe to ≈øerve them by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own ≈øide, and to omit no precautions to a≈ø≈øure them≈øelves of their per≈øons, ≈øo that they may not catch them; the ho≈øtages of women and children being not alwayes ≈øufficient (as <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> ob≈øerveth at the enterpri≈øe of <hi>Darges</hi>) for that ≈øome traitours are ≈øo re≈øolute as they will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all to attein the height of their de≈øignes, and make account to relea≈øe their pledges by ≈øuch pri≈øoners as they intend to take.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth a word to be ≈øpoken of alarms.

If the garri≈øon be weak, the ≈øcalado ea≈øie, and the place large, this la≈øt way of going to the alarm is the be≈øt, becau≈øe they go more readily to the defen≈øe of the walls; but in this ca≈øe they mu≈øt have no ≈øu≈øpicion of the fidelitie of the inhabitants.</p>

                     <p>THe enterpri≈øes of fortified places are made after ≈øeverall fa≈øhions, either by petard, or by ≈øcalado, or by ≈øome holes in the wals, or by ≈øau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidges, or by ≈øome ≈øuch other wayes and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which men ≈øeek every day to encrea≈øe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mea≈øure of the remedies again≈øt ≈øuch as are alreadie invented.

go on that ≈øervice into eminent danger: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there mu≈øt be great prudence u≈øed, and none imployed in it but re≈øolute men and ≈øecret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they mu≈øt either there overcome or peri≈øh; which happeneth not in ≈øuch enterpri≈øes where there is as great care taken of the ≈øafety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating as of giving on. The Mar≈øhall of <hi>Bri≈øac</hi> made one (being in <hi>Piedmont</hi>) upon the ca≈øtle of <hi>Millain,</hi> which was excellently well conducted, and de≈øerveth to be here taken notice of, to ≈øerve for a le≈ø≈øon for ≈øuch as may de≈øire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the like.

The fir≈øt rendez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The manner of meeting at this farm-hou≈øe was thus; At the parting from the valley <hi>Camonica</hi> or <hi>Bergama≈øque,</hi> the fir≈øt five or brigado (and ≈øo by turns all the re≈øt) found a countrey-fellow having a ≈øtraw-hat with two phea≈øants feathers on it; to whom the chief

man of every brigado was to ≈øay, <hi>O buon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagno, voi tu vender my quella capelina!</hi> that is, <hi>Ho, good fellow, wilt thou ≈øell me that hat?</hi> to which he was to an≈øwer, <hi>Me≈ø≈øer no, ne ho bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øogno per me;</hi> that is, <hi>No ≈øir, I must u≈øe it my ≈øelf.</hi> That was the watchword; which being ≈øo known, the chief (without ≈øpeaking a word) followed the countrey-fellow, which conducted him with his brigado to the farm-hou≈øe where <hi>Lodowick Birague</hi> was; and in this wi≈øe the Mar≈øhall of <hi>Bri≈øac</hi> his hundred and twenty ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pa≈ø≈øed very ≈øecretly to that place. From this farm-hou≈øe they were to get to the hou≈øe of one of <hi>Sienna</hi> near <hi>Millain,</hi> who was the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the de≈øigne: to this end they pa≈ø≈øed along as before, by five and five together, and after they had pa≈ø≈øed the river <hi>Adde</hi> at the haven of <hi>Vaure,</hi> they had mea≈øured the time to arrive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night at the bridge <hi>Navilio</hi> of <hi>Millain,</hi> near the Mona≈øtery of <hi>Angels;</hi> on which bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, the chief of the brigado ≈øhaked a little bell, at the ≈øound of which he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered by another like it, and pre≈øently there came (from below the bridge) the man of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> (the authour of this de≈øigne) who conducted the brigado to his own hou≈øe, and continued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner every night, untill the whole troup was pa≈øt: which is a matter worth the ob≈øerving, to cau≈øe a hundred and twenty ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to go by ≈øtealth from <hi>Piedmont</hi> to the very gates of <hi>Millain,</hi> without being di≈øcovered, and not a man of them (except onely <hi>Salvai≈øon</hi> and <hi>Peter Maria</hi> of <hi>Recuperat</hi>) untill then, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither they went or where they were. Concerning the conducting in gro≈ø≈øe, which is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7521:72"/>
the more ordinary, you mu≈øt mea≈øure the length of the way to the place upon which you have your de≈øigne, with the time which you mu≈øt have to arrive at the ju≈øt time to execute it: wherein many deceive them≈øelves very often, for that u≈øually there befall unexpected ca≈øualties which prolong the time; in≈øomuch that what mea≈øures ≈øoever you take (without great experience in ≈øuch actions) you ≈øhall commonly find the time too ≈øhort, e≈øpecially if you have a gro≈ø≈øe troup to lead. For to make two thou≈øand men to march by night in their long order, the Altes which mu≈øt be made at the head to ≈øtay for the rear, or tho≈øe which a narrow or trouble≈øome way, or that is cut off by a river compell you to make, are ≈øuch, and cau≈øe you to lo≈øe ≈øo much time, that unle≈ø≈øe you be very diligent to make them march, and that you have cau≈øed good intelligence to be taken of the way, and provided for all the≈øe things, you will find you have not half time enough. I ≈øpeak not of the great ≈øhowers of rain, nor of fro≈øts, which ≈øometimes happen ≈øo unlooked for and extraordinary, that, what fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight ≈øoever you may have u≈øed in all other things, it is impo≈ø≈øible to overcome them. After that you have proportioned the time with the way, you mu≈øt provide your ≈øelf of good guides, and as many of them as may be: then you mu≈øt form your order before you depart, as it ≈øhould be at the execution, giving to every man your commands in writing of what he is to do, and keeping a regi≈øter thereof. For if you deferre to do it untill you come upon the place where you are to alight, and where all the equipage is to be accommodated (which is u≈øually about half
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7521:73"/>
a league from the place) may hinder you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the place haply will not be ≈øpacious enough nor commodious to make the order, contentions which may befall, jealou≈øie of honour among≈øt the ≈øouldiers, and divers unthought-of accidents w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ari≈øe, are able to fru≈øtrate the de≈øigne: which things being re≈øolved on before your going out, and there being nothing to be changed in your order, this (mo≈øt certainly) is the means to avoid ≈øuch ob≈øtacles. I adde this, That if it be a citie from whence you go out, you mu≈øt keep the gates ≈øhut long before and after; and cau≈øe the troups to march by day, that ≈øo you may ≈øee that not a man go out but they of the enterpri≈øe. And afterwards to cau≈øe the troups to make Alte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the gate or in ≈øome private place near hand. Concerning the order; you mu≈øt cau≈øe ≈øome hor≈øe to march foremo≈øt, who≈øe ≈øcouts mu≈øt have charge to ride farre enough before, and to ≈øei≈øe upon all ≈øorts of per≈øons where≈øoever they go, that ≈øo they may hinder the giving of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the town which you intend to ≈øurpri≈øe; e≈øpecially if there be ≈øome bridge or pa≈ø≈øage by which unavoydably you mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe, you mu≈øt gain that. Then mu≈øt fifty musketiers follow; next the train, the petards or ladders, being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by tho≈øe men which are cho≈øen to carry them; whereof there mu≈øt be a treble number, to ea≈øe and ≈øucceed each other, in ca≈øe any be hurt or killed: and the≈øe mu≈øt be men of execution, the mo≈øt re≈øolute and adventurous of the troup; for on the≈øe foremo≈øt u≈øually the good or bad ≈øucce≈ø≈øe dependeth: you mu≈øt al≈øo carry double equipage of petards, becau≈øe all work not that effect which you purpo≈øe they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7521:73"/>
≈øhould; and often the want of one petard hath cau≈øed brave enterpri≈øes to fail, and ≈øo of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are often broken by the enemies, or break by being too much laden. In the pur≈øuit you mu≈øt not make any troup of above fifty ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, namely fifty muskets, then fifty pikes, and ≈øo ≈øucce≈ø≈øively: for you mu≈øt con≈øider that the fir≈øt encounters are in narrow ≈øtreets, and in the night; ≈øo that the gro≈ø≈øe troups cau≈øe but di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And if you find ≈øtreets that are broader then the order which you have framed, you mu≈øt joyn two troups together, that ≈øo they may take up the whole breadth of the ≈øtreet. Every troup mu≈øt have officers at the front and rear of it, and the ≈øergeants on the flanks, to keep them to their duties, and to hinder them from ≈øtraggling and pillaging. You mu≈øt al≈øo ob≈øerve in the order you make (when you part from your quarter) that if you make ≈øeverall a≈ø≈øaults, the commanders, ≈øouldiers, and equipage mu≈øt be di≈øtingui≈øhed into ≈øo many troups as you will make a≈ø≈øaults, and that they march according to the order they ≈øhould a≈ø≈øail in. In all enterpri≈øes (e≈øpecially in tho≈øe where the retreat is dangerous and long) you mu≈øt more regard to have good ≈øouldiers then many; for a ≈ømall troup may come from farther off, march more ≈øecretly, and retreat with le≈ø≈øe danger and confu≈øion then a gro≈ø≈øe troup. Be≈øides, a ≈ømall troup with good ≈øtore of officers, is more obedient in execution, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth le≈ø≈øe di≈øorder then a gro≈ø≈øe, I adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in enterpri≈øes by night you affright an enemy as much with a ≈ømall troup as with a great one: for it is a maxime, That they which are ≈øurpri≈øed and a≈ø≈øailed fight in fear, alwayes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7521:74"/>
per≈øwading them≈øelves that you a≈ø≈øail them with forces ≈øufficient. Briefly, if you overcome with a ≈ømall troup you get more honour then if it had been with a great, which ofttimes di≈øturbeth you both in fight, in march, and in their retreat: and if you be beaten, the di≈øhonour is the le≈ø≈øe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the third, which is the execution, all the order mu≈øt be given in writing, that ≈øo none of them which have any command in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe may excu≈øe them≈øelves by pretending they mi≈øunder≈øtood you. If it be by ≈øcalado, there mu≈øt be 2 men to carry every piece of a ladder; and becau≈øe it is almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible to do the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution upon a place where there needeth more then five pieces of ladders in height, it is ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that there be ten men for every ladder, and one man to command them: The men for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ladder mu≈øt be mentioned in a roll by their names and ≈øurnames, and of what company they be. You mu≈øt command them on pain of death to bring back their ladders if you cannot get the town: for they ≈øeeing the danger and trouble of bringing them back again, will rather de≈øire to do their uttermo≈øt endeavour to enter the town moreover you mu≈øt command ten other men to enter after the fir≈øt ten, which mu≈øt be led by an officer, and another to be on their rear to take care to ≈øee them mount without lo≈øing of time and without making too much ha≈øt: otherwi≈øe the ladders will be ≈øo much laden as that they will break; after this, ten more mu≈øt follow, commanded and divided as the former: and every file of ten mu≈øt know by which ladder they mu≈øt mount, and in what order, that ≈øo al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which follow their ladder mu≈øt carry another, though they have no order to rai≈øe it; that ≈øo if any piece of the fir≈øt ≈øhould break, there may another be rai≈øed in the ≈øtead. If it be by petard, the petardier ≈øhall call him that is to carry the madrier or planchier; then he is to call three for the petard (two to carry it, and the third to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in time of need) and if the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier be fa≈øtned to the petard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> foure men may carry it interchangeably by two and two: and tho≈øe two which carry not the petard with the planchier ≈øhall each of them have a great ≈ømiths hammer. After the≈øe foure, the petardier ≈øhall call two men, each of them carrying a great ax; after them one with a crow-lever, then another with a dark-lantern, then one with three or foure pieces of lighted matches: be≈øides the≈øe there mu≈øt be one to command them, which ≈øhall carry a piercing in≈øtrument, or a coopers turrell, or ≈øome good hooks with ≈øteeled points, and a weighty hammer. So that to attend every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard well there mu≈øt be ten men; this file of ten for the fir≈øt petard ≈øhall be led by ≈øome brave Sergeant, which ≈øhall have the name of every man of his file in writing, and ≈øhall al≈øo know what every of them is to carry. The men mu≈øt know the Mule which carrieth their equipage, and ≈øo ≈øoon as they come to the place where they are to unlade, they mu≈øt place them≈øelves about the Mule, that ≈øo each of them may receive what he is to carry. If the ≈øecond petard mu≈øt be applied to a gate or barres, they which ≈øhall carry it mu≈øt be in the ≈øame order as they of the fir≈øt petard: but if it be for a draw-bridge, the rolling-bridge or carriage goeth formo≈øt, with ≈øeven or

eight men which are imployed as well to carry it as to pu≈øh it forward: after this the planchier and petard mu≈øt be carried, after the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the fir≈øt; then ≈øhall they follow (in file and in clo≈øe order) which carry the ladders and planks to ca≈øt upon the breach which the petard ≈øhall have made upon the draw-bridge; then ≈øhall they follow which carry ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mers, hatchets, pin≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, in≈øtruments to pull out bolts and to cut chains; then ≈øome with fire-lances and granadoes, and ≈øome dark lanterns.

At all the gates and bridges the men mu≈øt be di≈øpo≈øed in the ≈øame order. But when you go again≈øt iron-grates or portcullices, you mu≈øt cau≈øe tho≈øe to march fir≈øt which carry the tre≈ø≈øes or iron-hooks; then marcheth the planchier and the petard; after which follow hammers, hatchets, crows of iron, and other in≈øtruments which may be thought fitting: you mu≈øt not forget to carry fire-balls, granadoes, or fire-lances, if you have ob≈øerved that you may make u≈øe of them; every man mu≈øt carry a hatchet at his girdle: you mu≈øt rather have a ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary number of in≈øtruments, then want one.

When you come near the place where the execution is to be done, you mu≈øt di≈øtribute to every man what he is to carry. The Sergeant ordereth them in file, and commandeth every one duly to follow his leader: then he cau≈øeth them to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to give room to tho≈øe of the ≈øecond petard; and ≈øo con≈øequently of all the re≈øt, there being a guide for the fir≈øt file to ≈øhew them the way. And that you may not be intangled, ≈øometimes you may cau≈øe ten cuiraciers to march before one foot, to di≈øcover whether the enemy be not on the advenues; then follow three men bearing good targets, to ≈øhelter (among≈øt others) the petardier; then march they which carry the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards and the other train, in ≈øuch order as hath been ≈øaid, which ≈øhall be followed by fifty muskets led by a Captain, to give fire for their defen≈øe (if need be) with large hail≈øhot. He mu≈øt look that no man ≈øtay by the way as they march; when the enemy asketh, <hi>Who goeth there,</hi> they mu≈øt ha≈øten their pace, and then the petar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier taketh the fir≈øt petard with him, and the re≈øt mu≈øt follow very clo≈øe, that ≈øo when the fir≈øt is fired the ≈øecond be ready to be put into his hands.

The fir≈øt petard being fired, the officer ≈øhall cau≈øe his men to be placed on the right and left hand,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7521:76"/>
to give room for the ≈øecond petard; then that ≈øhall do the ≈øame, to give pa≈ø≈øage to the third; then that maketh room for the rolling-bridge, and they for the petards and other in≈øtruments, and con≈øequently all the re≈øt. And they which are unladen mu≈øt help the re≈øt, without making any noi≈øe. And if the petardier calleth for any thing, he that carrieth it mu≈øt be ready to give it him, and no man upon pain of death mu≈øt ≈øtirre out of the place where he was placed, but onely to give to the petardier what he calleth for, or to ≈øupply ≈øome bodies place which in carrying ≈øomething to the petardier was hurt or killed. The officers mu≈øt take care that the petardier be pre≈øently ≈øerved, and all be done without noi≈øe or confu≈øion. The ouverture being made, they which ≈øhall be commanded for the fir≈øt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts mu≈øt be ready to enter, and to force what≈øoever ≈øhall re≈øi≈øt them; they which are to follow them mu≈øt do the like, and ≈øo con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the re≈øt which are to act any thing: And when they are within, they which fir≈øt entred mu≈øt not ≈øcatter them≈øelves in the town (while≈øt they are yet weak) whether it be in pur≈øuing the enemy, or though they meet none: but they mu≈øt make two bodies, the one to act, the other onely to be put into battalia to ≈øu≈øtein the re≈øt. This done, they mu≈øt march in good order, the one to force that whereunto they are appointed, the other to go and embattel them≈øelves in the ≈øtreets and market-places which you had re≈øolved ought to be ≈øei≈øed upon, by the plat or draught of the town, by which the whole enterpri≈øe ought to have been de≈øigned.

If you be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øed, that troup which is without ≈øhall make the retreat, and ≈øhall remain firm in battalia untill that the repul≈øed troups be recollected and put in order: but if they which entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ma≈øters of the town, to hold it they mu≈øt di≈øarm the town≈ømen before they di≈øarm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of a≈ø≈øaults by ≈øieges.</head>
                     <p>IN the two chapters of ≈øurpri≈øes I have begun with the means to defend ones ≈øelf, for that we mu≈øt never undertake to attempt the ≈øurpri≈øe of any fort, but upon the defects which are to be found in them: ≈øo that he which knoweth not on which part nor after which manner he ought to make his a≈ø≈øault, mu≈øt be prepared for all manner of accidents. In the≈øe two I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to treat of the a≈ø≈øailing of towns by ≈øieges, for that you mu≈øt ob≈øerve by what place and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner you are a≈ø≈øailed, to make a good defen≈øe again≈øt it.</p>
                     <p>Sieges are undertaken either by blocking up of towns to fami≈øh them, or by taking them by force; for both the one and the other you mu≈øt be ma≈øter of the field, and you mu≈øt have two armies, the one to hinder the enemy from undertaking any thing, and the other to form your ≈øiege. Or in any ca≈øe you mu≈øt be the fir≈øt in the field, that you may ≈øo fortifie your ≈øelf before the town you be≈øiege as you may be able to maintein your ≈øelf there in ≈øpite of the furious attempts of the enemy. To get the town which you mean to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiege at the ea≈øier rate, you mu≈øt attempt to ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe it when there is but a ≈ømall garri≈øon in it: to this end you are to u≈øe all manner of inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to keep them from the knowledge of your purpo≈øe to be≈øiege it; then all on a ≈øudden you
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7521:77"/>
mu≈øt go and block it up. But if (notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your ≈øtratagemes) you be not able to ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe it at unawares, or that you apprehend the charge to be too great, it will be better to make ≈øome other ≈øiege of le≈ø≈øe importance: for a town well and ob≈øtinately defended is the ruine of an army; and if it be not taken, it often dimini≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reputation of the commander which a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øailed it.</p>
                     <p>For this cau≈øe, before you undertake any ≈øuch thing, it mu≈øt be well con≈øidered on; and you mu≈øt provide your ≈øelf abundantly of all things nece≈ø≈øary to effect it. When you form a ≈øiege, you mu≈øt appoint your quarters (a≈ømuch as may be) in healthfull places, and be carefull to make them ≈øpacious enough, and to keep them clean: for you mu≈øt account upon your time of abode there, that your army be not wa≈øted by di≈øea≈øes. You mu≈øt make the quarters of your army ≈øo near the town be≈øieged as may be, yet ≈øo as they be not di≈øcommodated by their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie: And if the ground be level and lie open round about, the quarters mu≈øt be out of reach of the cannon. You mu≈øt make as many quarters as the places are which you intend to a≈ø≈øault, or at lea≈øt as the bigne≈ø≈øe of the town be≈øieged, or the ≈øituation thereof requireth. Neverthele≈ø≈øe I would have the Generals quarters to be ≈øo large, as (in a ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity) it might receive all the troups of the other quarters; If you make a ≈øiege with a ≈ømall army, and that the garri≈øon be ≈øtrong, you mu≈øt fortifie the quarters one after another, with the whole body of the army; and in this ca≈øe you mu≈øt make the fewer quarters, and attempt the fewer places. But if you find
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7521:78"/>
your ≈øelf ≈øtrong enough you may abbridge the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe and make them all at once. Be≈øides this, you mu≈øt make a circumvallation wi h forts and redoubts without reach of cannon of the be≈øie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which ≈øhall joyn all the quarters one to the other, behind which your army may pre≈øent it ≈øelf in battalia, and this line mu≈øt be led in ≈øuch manner as it may po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe all the commanding places. And if the garri≈øon of the town be≈øieged be ≈øo ≈øtrong as you may fear to be a≈ø≈øailed on both ≈øides, you mu≈øt make another circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the town, the neare≈øt that may be, that ≈øo it may require the fewer men to guard it: for it being made to oppo≈øe your ≈øelf again≈øt the town, you need not take care to make it out of the reach of the cannon. For the opening of the trenches, you are to u≈øe the more or fewer ceremonies, according as the garri≈øon is ≈øtrong or weak. If it be ≈øtrong, you begin by a good fort, and continue by good redoubts along the trenches, leaving onely ≈øentinels in them. For it is an old errour to think to defend trenches. If the garri≈øon be weak, you need not make ≈øo much ado to gain time. The batteries mu≈øt be well ≈øtrengthened by good moats, and flanked by good corps-du-guards, to pre≈øerve them again≈øt the ≈øallies of the be≈øieged. If there be any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works which are not yet in good defen≈øe, and which may be carried by force, you mu≈øt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt them; otherwi≈øe you mu≈øt approch them by little and little: for it is there where the brave≈øt defen≈øe is made, becau≈øe that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they can ea≈øilie≈øt make their ≈øallies. When the outworks are taken, and the cannon is planted on the counter≈øcarp, and you ≈øap into
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7521:78"/>
the moat, and prepare your ≈øelf to lay over your galleries to get over to the bulwarks, you mu≈øt then place your musketiers all along the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter≈øcarp, that ≈øo under favour of them and of your cannon you may pa≈ø≈øe over your galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If the moats be drie, they will di≈øpute it with you, but at la≈øt the ≈øtronger overcometh the weaker. If they be full of ≈øtanding water, that hindereth you not from making your caw≈øie whereupon you place your gallerie: If they be full of running water, you mu≈øt make u≈øe of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bridges to put over your miners. When you are got clo≈øe to the bulwarks, you are to u≈øe mines (great or ≈ømall) ≈øo by little and little to get into the ground, and the retrenchments which may be made behind the bulwarks. I trouble not my ≈øelf here to ≈øhew how to make the quarters, forts, circumvallations, the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (that they lie not open to the enemy) the batteries, (that they be well a≈ø≈øured) the de≈øcents into the moat, how to a≈ø≈øail the fal≈øe brayes, how the galleries are to be made, al≈øo the mines, and the lodgings which are to be made after they be ≈øprung; becau≈øe what≈øoever may be ≈øaid on that ≈øubject is alreadie written, and it mu≈øt be experience that mu≈øt perfect the re≈øt; where every day ≈øomething is altered or ≈øome new thing is added.</p>

For what will a well fortified place ≈øerve for if there be not ≈øouldiers to defend it? or what good will ≈øouldiers do if they have neither arms nor munitions of warre to fight? neither will arms nor munitions avail, if they want bread to live by; to which I adde in≈øtruments to work in the earth, without which it is impo≈ø≈øible to make any great re≈øi≈øtance. But it is not enough to have all that is nece≈ø≈øary for re≈øi≈øtance; there mu≈øt be a good order and rule kept, otherwi≈øe it will all be di≈ø≈øipated by tho≈øe which will de≈øire to get out of danger quickly, and will find ≈øome pretext to yield upon terms which ≈øhall not be di≈øhonourable; the number of ≈øuch being alwayes greater then of tho≈øe which will re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7521:79"/>
You mu≈øt take an inventory in the town of all the iron, wood, linen, in≈øtruments to work in the ground, drugs fit for artificiall fires, and other ≈øuch things nece≈ø≈øary for a ≈øiege: and take care that there be alwayes of them in the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins to ≈øerve for the pre≈øent nece≈ø≈øity: and to avoid di≈øorder in the di≈øtribution of all the≈øe things, there mu≈øt be a coun≈øel which mu≈øt have the over≈øight thereof, and which ≈øhall cau≈øe all to be delivered out and received in according to the order of the Governour and the Coun≈øel of warre. The≈øe things thus put in order, you mu≈øt think upon defen≈øe, which is done princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally after two wayes, by holding the enemy off by retrenchment, and by hindring him (when he approcheth) by ≈øallies.</p>
                     <p>For the fir≈øt; it is approved and practiced by all; and he which breaketh ground be≈øt, and beginneth to di≈øpute it the furthe≈øt off, is he which maketh the longe≈øt re≈øi≈øtance. For the ≈ømalle≈øt retrenchment without (accommodated with palli≈øadoes) is hard to be forced. But if it be mined, and that there be another made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, it is a dangerous piece to enter, and you con≈øtrain the enemy to approch by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and with the ≈øame ceremonies which are u≈øed to fall upon the bulwarks and the great moat; ≈øo that by divers retrenchments you keep off the enemy at a di≈øtance a long time before he can come to fall upon the counter≈øcarp, who cannot take away your outworks but by mines, which taketh up good ≈øtore of time. The moat al≈øo may be defended if it be dry by portable ca≈øemats (which are called coffers) incircled by little moats or palli≈øadoes to hinder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7521:80"/>
which are placed in ≈øeverall places of the great moat to defend it, and not to be di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the cannon of the a≈ø≈øailant. The bulwarks are al≈øo to be defended by retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which you are to make either at the point, or at the middle, or at the gorge, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are capable, and that the mines of the be≈øiegers do enter forward within the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks. And when all that is forced, the la≈øt defen≈øe is a retrenchment of the whole town, reducing it to keep onely one part of it.</p>
                     <p>For the ≈øecond way of defen≈øe; in ≈øtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øallies to drive back them that work in the approches ≈øome would have onely ≈øome few to good purpo≈øe, in great nece≈ø≈øitie; alleaging that the be≈øieged there alwayes lo≈øe ≈øome men, and of the be≈øt of them, which they ought to con≈øerve again≈øt a ≈øtrong a≈ø≈øault; and that oftentimes they which would have a fair pretext to yield the town cau≈øe their ≈øouldiers to be maimed by continuall ≈øallies, to ≈øhew that they yield not them≈øelves but through nece≈ø≈øitie. For mine own part (which do approve of the quantitie of ≈øallies, and which have alwayes ≈øeen the works of the a≈ø≈øailants retarded by them more in one houre then in eight dayes by other defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes) I an≈øwer, that the≈øe rea≈øons would carry ≈øome ≈øhew if the town were attempted by a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øault; for they not taking any other but that way at that time, it were fit to pre≈øerve the ≈øouldiers to with≈øtand them: but while≈øt the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øailant getteth ground by little and little, if you defend not the town otherwi≈øe then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, you mu≈øt lo≈øe it at la≈øt: wherein your quantitie of ≈øouldiers ≈øtandeth you in no
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7521:80"/>
≈øtead at all, in ≈øo much that the care you have taken to pre≈øerve your ≈øouldiers doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the taking of the town one day; but if by your brave ≈øallies you ruine batteries, throw down trenches, force the redoubts which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; and when they are within the moat you burn their galleries, they mu≈øt be inforced to begin their work anew as ofttimes as you overthrow it; in≈øomuch as the be≈øieger finding him≈øelf ≈øo enterteined, he approcheth with much more ceremonie, and at la≈øt his ≈øouldiers draw back. So that in my opinion it is very fit that the be≈øieged ≈øhould make frequent ≈øallies; but they mu≈øt make them at ≈øeverall houres, that ≈øo they may the better ≈øurpri≈øe the enemy with few men (but re≈øolute) to avoid the di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the retreat, and to do no other thing but what is commanded. For though you find not re≈øi≈øtance at the falling on, as is u≈øuall, if you ≈øtay to little purpo≈øe, you runne the hazard to be ill led off at the retreat. The other particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of defen≈øe depend upon tho≈øe of a≈ø≈øail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the be≈øiegers teaching you by nece≈ø≈øitie what you are to do; wherein there is nothing but practice and experience which can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of Artillery.</head>
                     <p>IT is fit to ≈øpeak of Artillery after ≈øieges, ≈øince it is principally by means thereof that towns are taken; and that ≈øince this hath been in u≈øe, there are no places found impregnable, if they be not inacce≈ø≈øible: It hath changed all the form and matter of fortifications: for in ≈øtead of towers and ancient walls, which have not been able to re≈øi≈øt it, we now make bulwarks and other works of earth. We may ≈øay that it hath even in a manner altered the manner of making warre. Anciently they began their approches to towns where now we end them: for on the fir≈øt day they lodged on the brim of the moat; and now adayes we mu≈øt go a great way before we come at it: then the circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was made out of reach of arrows onely, now they mu≈øt be made beyond reach of cannon: then it mattered not though the fortre≈ø≈øes of the encamped armies were overtopped, ≈øo as they had their other conveniences; now-adayes there mu≈øt be care taken above all things that they be not. In tho≈øe times two armies were quietly led in batalia at two or three hundred paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance from each other, and remained there whole dayes without being able to be di≈ølodged but by a hazard of a general battel; now one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be before another but out of the reach of the cannon, otherwi≈øe he that hath mo≈øt of them, or that hath planted them be≈øt, beateth out the other without fighting. At that time a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of an army could know the order of his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7521:81"/>
enemy at a near di≈øtance, and form his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, ≈øeeking his advantages upon the defects of another, and all without danger; now the≈øe things can no more be ob≈øerved but ≈øo farre off as you mu≈øt rather tru≈øt to your own good order then upon any defect in that of your enemy. Then one army could charge another without lo≈øing their order, becau≈øe they had not above two or three hundred paces to march; in the≈øe times it is impo≈ø≈øible to ob≈øerve it in ≈øight of the enemy for half a league together, and to find a plain which ≈øhall be even and without hindrances. Whereunto I adde further, that without a great exerci≈øe of marching in batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia you are not able to march a thou≈øand paces without lo≈øing all your di≈øtances of battalions and ≈øquadrons, and by con≈øequence without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in confu≈øion. Since therefore the cannon is of ≈øo great u≈øe in warre, and hath ≈øo great a ≈øhare in the victory, it is nece≈ø≈øary that you know how to make good u≈øe of it. It is an engine which all cannot well imploy, for it is of great expen≈øe, and belongeth onely to great and pui≈ø≈øant States to make ordinary u≈øe of them. They tie them to a great charge for draught, there being a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred draught-hor≈øes required to draw one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non for battery through all kinds of wayes, and to ≈øhoot onely a hundred bullets. By this you may judge according to the number which you mean to imploy what length of ground it taketh up. To mannage one piece of battery well, there mu≈øt be eighteen men: be≈øides, how many ≈ømiths, carters, farriers, and other workmen mu≈øt there be in the train to repair the carriages? how many carpenters to make bridges? how

how many pioners to accommodate the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes? Briefly an army which carrieth cannon with it cannot march but lei≈øurely, and that which hath none can do no great effect: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the≈øe times the artillery is an e≈ø≈øentiall part of an army; but withall, if the Generall ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth him≈øelf to be approched too near, without entrenching him≈øelf it is impo≈ø≈øible for him to di≈øintangle him≈øelf without fighting, or lo≈øing it; which cannot ≈øo happen without lo≈øing much of his reputation. For this rea≈øon he ought to inform him≈øelf very particularly of all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the artillery: and that he may not be deceived, he mu≈øt know the lea≈øt even of the ≈ømalle≈øt things, namely, of the mixture, founding, proportion, weight, calibre, and carriage; of what wood it mu≈øt be, how it mu≈øt be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the ≈øeverall wayes, miry or mountainous; how to pa≈ø≈øe rivers, how to ≈øecure the batteries, as well again≈øt the cannon of the enemy as again≈øt his ≈øallies; what ground the cannon mu≈øt have for his rever≈øe, what di≈øtance between piece and piece; in what manner the platform mu≈øt be made, at what di≈øtance the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are ≈øufficient, and other things, whereof I do not here ≈øpecifie the particulars, becau≈øe others have written of them. It ≈øufficeth me to ≈øhew the u≈øe of artillerie, the chargeablene≈ø≈øe of it, the turmoil of it, and whereunto it engageth you, to incite Generals not to rely upon others; and to know the benefit and di≈øcommoditie thereof ≈øo well, that they may make u≈øe of the one to their advantage, and avoid the other by their fore≈øight.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the baggage and pioners.</head>
                     <p>AFter the great turmoil of the artillery, I will ≈øpeak a word of that of the baggage. It is a great ≈øhame to lo≈øe it, but it is al≈øo a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pre≈øerve it when it is exce≈ø≈øive; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing that bringeth ≈øo much di≈øorder to an army: therefore it is highly nece≈ø≈øary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the ≈ømalle≈øt proportion that may be, and to make a review of it every moneth; for it groweth in the twinkling of an eye. We are ≈øo delicate now a dayes as we will hardly carry our arms, much le≈ø≈øe would we carry a weeks victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all about us. So long as ≈øuch an abu≈øe be ≈øuffered in an army, it will make it ≈øelf incapable to do any thing that is good. For as in a battel he which can la≈øt pre≈øerve ≈øome troups which have not fought, carrieth away the victory; ≈øo he that la≈øt keepeth his army in health, complete, and accu≈øtomed to labour, doth the like: which he cannot do if the ≈øouldiers be ≈øo delicate as they cannot carry their baggage. Be≈øides that, ≈øickne≈ø≈øe and famine getteth not into an army, but by this ra≈øcalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ie of ≈øouldiers boyes: and this thing which ≈øeemeth to be a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is of ≈øuch importance, as it is for the mo≈øt part the di≈ø≈øipation of the mo≈øt flouri≈øhing, yea I dare ≈øay, of the mo≈øt victorious armies. It is principally in the time of pro≈øperity that men grow effeminate, and give them≈øelves to take their ea≈øe; and in that time it ought lea≈øt to be done, if after the example of the delicacies of <hi>Capua</hi> where <hi>Hannibals</hi> army imba≈øed it ≈øelf,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7521:83"/>
they would not do the ≈øame. Whil≈øt we are about cutting off unnece≈ø≈øary things from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I will ≈øay a word concerning pioners. There be Captains of our time which will have an unbridled number of them, and ≈øay, that it were better to cut off ≈øome regiments of ≈øouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to take pioners in their ≈øtead, which are nece≈ø≈øary to make the inclo≈øures of the camp, the trenches in a ≈øiege, the accommodation of the wayes; briefly, to take away all imployment from the ≈øouldiers of working in the ground, for that they in the≈øe times cannot be brought to be ≈øubject to ≈øuch labours as the ancient Romanes were: alledging further, that the ≈øouldier when he arriveth at his quarter, is ≈øufficiently tired, though he be not imployed a new to ca≈øt up earth. An opinion whereat I cannot wonder enough, and which ≈øtrengthneth me in that which I hold, that we ≈øpoil our ≈øouldiers by ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them too much. There mu≈øt be care taken for their livelihood, for their clothing, for ≈øuch as are ≈øick and hurt: but they mu≈øt be hardned to labour, and their Generall and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders mu≈øt be examples to them. For if you will reduce them to content them≈øelves with a little while≈øt you bur≈øt your ≈øelf with exce≈ø≈øe of meat, and to labour while≈øt you glory it, and live in lazine≈ø≈øe; I confe≈ø≈øe they will murmure. But to return to the pioners: it is nece≈ø≈øary you ≈øhould have them to accommodate the wayes, for the artillery principally; for which five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred may ≈øerve for a great equipage. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inclo≈øing of the camp, the ≈øouldier is bound to make it; for that this labour procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him a means to re≈øt him≈øelf and to ≈øleep in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7521:83"/>
≈øafetie. I ≈øay further, that it is a work which mu≈øt be done in three or foure houres; to this end all the army worketh at it, or at lea≈øt half of it, when the enemy is near hand. So that if we mu≈øt needs have it done by pioners, there had need be as many of them in an army as there are ≈øouldiers, which would be a means to fami≈øh a whole countrey, and to encrea≈øe the turmoil, which we would dimini≈øh. Concerning the trenches; I never ≈øaw it ≈øucceed well when pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did it; and while≈øt the danger groweth, the mo≈øt valiant ≈øouldiers are not too good for that imployment; and further they mu≈øt be incited to that work by the gain of it: which will ≈øerve to a≈ø≈øure them≈øelves the better in that danger, and to give them a means to ≈øpare ≈øomething to cloth them≈øelves; and no money is ≈øo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as that in an army.</p>

                     <p>THere be yet two ≈øorts of people whereof (contrary to the pioners) there cannot be too many in an army; which are ≈øpies and guides. The fir≈øt adverti≈øe you of the deportments of the enemy, upon who≈øe report either you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe ≈øomething upon him, or you guard your ≈øelf from his de≈øignes. The ≈øecond give you knowledge of the countrey, of the wayes and pa≈ø≈øages by which you are to pa≈ø≈øe, or el≈øe by what way your enemy can come to you. Both the one and the other mu≈øt be faithfull, for that in advi≈øing you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>al≈øly, or guiding you maliciou≈øly, they may cau≈øe you to fall into great dangers.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7521:84"/>
You mu≈øt have good ≈øtore of guides: for that (e≈øpecially if you march by night) every gro≈ø≈øe troup (or at lea≈øt every body) hath need of their own; and before you ≈øet forward, they mu≈øt all be agreed on the way which they will take. There mu≈øt be a Captain of the guides, a man of ≈øpirit, and vigilant, and that may take care to get guides fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> place to place. Concerning ≈øpies, there mu≈øt be ≈øomething more ob≈øerved in them, and you mu≈øt be alwayes ≈øu≈øpicious of them: for that as it is a dangerous task for him that undertaketh it, ≈øo it is al≈øo for him that imployeth them. To this end it is nece≈ø≈øary that no man know them but he which imployeth them; and that ≈øpies may not know each other, that ≈øo they may not agree to give fal≈øe advi≈øes: for by this means by examining them ≈øeverally, by the agreement or di≈øagreement of their advi≈øes, you may judge whether they be good; and by the verification of tho≈øe which ≈øpeak true or fal≈øe, you ≈øhall know who betrayeth you, or doth you true ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And how≈øoever when you di≈øcover trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, yet I ≈øay you may make a profitable u≈øe of them, by feigning that you believe them to be faithfull, and giving them commi≈ø≈øions which they may di≈øcover to the enemy, that you have ≈øome de≈øigne quite contrary to that which you intend to put in execution; that ≈øo while≈øt he is preparing him≈øelf for one ≈øide, you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ≈øomething upon him on the other. But this is not all, to beware of your own ≈øpies; you mu≈øt al≈øo take heed of tho≈øe of the enemy; which you mu≈øt pre≈øuppo≈øe you have within your camp, as the enemy hath of yours. For this rea≈øon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the ≈øecre≈øie which mu≈øt be u≈øed in all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpri≈øes,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7521:84"/>
it is good to give a charge, by publi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in a ≈øtill way) that you have a quite contrary de≈øigne to that which you purpo≈øe to put in execution, that ≈øo tho≈øe ≈øpies may ≈øo report it to the enemy. But the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øentiall means to be well ≈øerved by this kind of men, is to be very liberall to them; for they are faithfull to them which give them mo≈øt.</p>

                     <p>BUt ≈øeeing it is to no purpo≈øe to have an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my compo≈øed of good commanders and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ≈øouldiers, well di≈øciplined and obedient, well furni≈øhed with artillery and munition, if they have not what to eat; I will di≈øtingui≈øh this chapter into five parts: the fir≈øt to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of corn; the ≈øecond to provide for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of it; the third of the ≈øafe conveying of it; the fourth of the making of good bread; and the fifth of the di≈øtribution of it. To this end the Commi≈ø≈øary generall of the victuall ought to be a man of authority, faithfull, vigilant, and active; and this office ought not to be de≈øpi≈øed (as now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes it is) nor given to men of mean quality; for it is of ≈øuch importance, that according as it is either well or ill di≈øcharged, it cau≈øeth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ≈øub≈øi≈øt, or go to ruine. And the <hi>Romanes</hi> alwayes committed it to ≈øome eminent per≈øon. To come to particulars, I will ≈øay that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of corn ought to be made in due time, in ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantitie, in a commodious place for tran≈øportation, and that choice be made of very good corn. For you mu≈øt not conceive any hope
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7521:85"/>
of finding it, either in the champain or towns where you are to go, becau≈øe the enemy may either hoard it up or burn it; and ≈øo on that hope you ≈øhall find in this onely point all your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignes fru≈øtrated. In the ≈øecond, you mu≈øt make Magazines in divers places, that ≈øo you may not be in danger to lo≈øe all at once, both in towns and ca≈øtles which are neare≈øt and mo≈øt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the tran≈øporting of corn into your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and (according to the ≈øituation of the countrey) you are to make provi≈øion of wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons or mules to carry it to the camp, where mu≈øt alwayes be a Magazine for a forthnight, which ≈øhould not be meddled with but in extremitie, or for ≈øome extraordinary enterpri≈øe. In the third place, the carriage of it ought not to be performed without a good convoy; and never on any prefixed day, to prevent the preparation of taking of it while≈øt it is on the way. In the fourth, to hinder the abu≈øes which are ordinarily u≈øed (and I dare ≈øay, ever, unle≈ø≈øe there be a very narrow looking to it) about the bread. For, for their private gain, they mingle bad grain with it, yea even earth, and u≈øe other ba≈øe tricks, whence for the mo≈øt part proceed di≈øea≈øes in an army; which is a mi≈øchief which cannot be too ≈øeverely puni≈øhed. And in the la≈øt place, that it may be well di≈øtributed and not wa≈øted; for if you tru≈øt the Sergeants, they alwayes take for double the number of ≈øouldiers they have in their companies: to this end it is nece≈ø≈øary that the Commi≈ø≈øarie generall of the victuall from week to week ≈øhould have an exact li≈øt of tho≈øe that are in the army, ≈øigned by the Generall, that ≈øo he may order the di≈øtribution of bread accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Be≈øides, you mu≈øt cau≈øe them to be puni≈øhed rigourou≈øly which pillage tho≈øe victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers and other per≈øons which bring victuall to the camp; whereof the price mu≈øt be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ≈øo the ≈øouldiers may not be ≈øharked upon. When you are at a well retrenched ≈øiege, where the hope to make you quit it con≈øi≈øteth in nothing el≈øe but in cutting off your victuall, you mu≈øt have that fore≈øight to cau≈øe ≈øo much to be brought within your camp as you judge to be nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øerve your turn for the time you believe you ≈øhall ≈øtay to take the town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieged; as <hi>Ce≈øar</hi> did before <hi>Alexia.</hi> There be many rules to be given on this ≈øubject, to hinder the abu≈øes which may be u≈øed therein, which I omit to avoid prolixitie: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Generall ought to have ab≈øolute power, which ought not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to any: for in warre more then in any other profe≈ø≈øion the command ought to be ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: and it is a very bad introduction to make Generals which command the army by the day, or by the week, or by the moneth. At all times when the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ≈øo, they ≈øped the wor≈øe for it.</p>
                     <p>Then there mu≈øt be a Lieutenant generall, or Mar≈øhall of the field generall, which ought to take care to cau≈øe all the Generalls commands to be put in execution as ab≈øolutely as him≈øelf, thereby to ea≈øe him: it being too hard a thing for the Generall to do all, e≈øpecially when the army marcheth; for that (of all nece≈ø≈øitie) there mu≈øt be a man of eminent authority at the head of an army, and whom all the other commanders do acknowledge. Sometimes there is a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall and a Mar≈øhall of the field gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to perform the≈øe two offices; neverthele≈ø≈øe the≈øe two places, being born by two men in an army, oftentimes bring confu≈øion, and cau≈øe

For it is in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie, where you ≈øhall meet with more men of wealth and good families, and con≈øequently more difficult to be made to obey; and therefore this authoritie ought not to be divided. And becau≈øe in marching the cavalrie is ordinarily in the front and in the rear, and that in lodging you are ofttimes compelled to make two fronts, and for that in time of battel the hor≈øe are at lea≈øt on the two wings, it is nece≈ø≈øary that there be a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7521:87"/>
Lieutenant Generall, a man al≈øo of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. There mu≈øt further be a third comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom the mo≈øt part call a Commi≈ø≈øary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who di≈øtributeth the orders, keepeth the li≈øt of the guards, of the convoyes, and other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and ought to go and take the orders from the Mar≈øhall of the field generall, to carry them to his Generall of the hor≈øe, who di≈øtributeth them to the Quarter-ma≈øters, which come for them from every quarter. All the cavalry mu≈øt be divided into companies, of which regiments are formed; not after the manner of the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, under the command of a Colonell; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintein the order of the lodgings and of battel. To form the≈øe regiments you put foure or five companies together, with one of carabines, and the anciente≈øt Captain commandeth that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and ≈øo all the cavalry is divided: which maketh it plainly evident how merely unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an office it is to have a generall command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the carabines; for the carabines cannot make a body, for that their want of fighting permitteth it not, neither were they in≈øtituted but to ≈øerve the cavalry, either at their quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to di≈øcover, or for intelligence, or to give a charge in the flank in time of fight, or in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to harrie them whom you chace, or to keep you from being ≈øo when you are pur≈øued.

                     <p>The infantery is the more ≈øolid body of an army: that of the artillery and victuall alwayes are quartered with it.

Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies make a regiment, which hath its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and many regiments make a body, which we call a <hi>Brigado</hi> of the army. The army is u≈øually divided into three bodies, Vanguard, Battel, and Rearguard. Every brigado hath its commander; and be≈øides it ought to have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Major of a brigado, and a Quarter-ma≈øter of a brigado; The fir≈øt to go and take the orders from the Mar≈øhall of the field generall, to carry them to the commander of his brigado; then he giveth the word to the Sergeant Majors of the regiments: and the other to give to every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ma≈øter of a regiment, either his quarter, or the ≈øpace of ground which is nece≈ø≈øary, for him to encamp in; and he divideth it to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Quarter-ma≈øters, or to the harbengers of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry company, which afterwards lodgeth them.

                     <p>The artillery ought to have a Generall, a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall, a Quarter-ma≈øter, then other officers. And for that all pioners, miners, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giniers, conductours of works, ≈ømiths, carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wheelwrights, and other workmen depend on him, I would e≈øtabli≈øh a commander for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øort of the≈øe men; which I would take either out of the commi≈ø≈øaries of the artillery, or other per≈øons apart, to addre≈ø≈øe my ≈øelf to them when I had need of ≈øuch men. The Quarter-ma≈øter mu≈øt every night go to receive the orders of the Mar≈øhall of the field generall. The charge of the victuals ought to be performed by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; he ought to have his Lieutenant, his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ma≈øter, and his other officers: his Quarter-ma≈øter mu≈øt every evening go and take the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Mar≈øhall of the field generall.</p>
                     <p>So then you ≈øee how the commands are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed: the Mar≈øhall of the field generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth them from the Generall, then goeth to his own lodging; there the Commi≈ø≈øary of hor≈øe cometh and receiveth them for the cavalry; the Sergeant Major generall for the infantery, who delivereth it to the Sergeant Majors of brigadoes: for the artillery to the Quarter-ma≈øter thereof; and ≈øo to him for the victuals: Briefly, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7521:88"/>
of the field generall ≈øpeaking with the≈øe foure per≈øons, giveth the orders to all the army. All orders and commands ought to be given in writing. The Mar≈øhall of the field generall, the Generall of the artillery, the Fi≈øcall, the Control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Exchequer, the Generall of victuall, the Quarter-ma≈øter generall, the Sergeant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor generall and the Provo≈øt generall mu≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be lodged within the Generalls quarter.</p>
                     <p>If all the army be encamped in bodies, the Quarter-ma≈øter generall giveth to each of the≈øe bodies the ≈øpace of ground which is fitting; which is afterwards di≈øtributed (in every body) by the officers thereunto appointed.</p>
                     <p>On a day of battel the Mar≈øhall of the field generall doth a≈ø≈øigne the place for every body; afterwards the Sergeant major generall ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the infantery into battalia.</p>
                     <p>The Mar≈øhall of the field generall ought to have three or foure a≈ø≈øi≈øtants for the field, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the extraordinary orders; but they mu≈øt not pretend to command any officer in chief, unle≈ø≈øe they formerly have been either Colonels or Captains of hor≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The Sergeant major generall mu≈øt command the Colonels; but that they may the readilier obey him, he ought to be taken out of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; and none ought ever to have that place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe he hath been one: as al≈øo the Sergeant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors of brigadoes ought to be taken out of the Sergeant majors of regiments. Things being thus regulated and e≈øtabli≈øhed, you ≈øhall ≈øee a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie in the commands, and none ≈øhall be able to excu≈øe his fault by putting it off upon another, becau≈øe pre≈øently it will be verified whence it

                     <p>AFter that you have formed an army, you mu≈øt imploy it, either for the conque≈øt of a new countre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, or for the defen≈øe of your own. We will begin with the fir≈øt. The Prince which putteth him≈øelf upon the offen≈øive mu≈øt be the ≈øtronger, or mu≈øt ≈øee ≈øome garboils in the State which he a≈ø≈øaileth, and that he be called thither by a partie: otherwi≈øe it would be a ra≈øh enterpri≈øe.</p>
                     <p>If the countrey which he a≈ø≈øaileth be large and open, he mu≈øt ≈øeek in the beginning to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a battel or ≈øome grand skirmi≈øh, that ≈øo by the reputation of his arms he may affright the enemies. If it be a countrey enclo≈øed with mountains, or divided by rivers and ditches, or ≈øheltered with forre≈øts, or full of fortre≈ø≈øes, it is hard to force an enemy to battel; and in this ca≈øe you mu≈øt go to ≈øieges, and make your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt by little and little. Now he that will make any progre≈ø≈øe by this way mu≈øt at lea≈øt have two bodies of armies; that ≈øo with the one he may hold his enemy in play, and with the other he may actuate without impeachment. For it is mo≈øt difficult to accompli≈øh the de≈øigne of a ≈øiege, ≈øo long as you have a good army encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near you, which ≈øhall cut off your victuall. If it be a countrey which is hard to enter, and that hath but few pa≈ø≈øages whereby to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, you mu≈øt force one; and before you go further, you mu≈øt there fortifie, and ≈øo well a≈ø≈øure
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7521:89"/>
your way for your victuall as you may not ≈øuffer though the enemy ≈øhould have burned or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away that of his countrey into his fortre≈ø≈øes. If you be called by a faction, that is a very great advantage for you; becau≈øe you are in≈øtructed of the ≈øituation of the countrey, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are to be found in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>tified pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and want not ≈øpies nor punctuall adverti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of what≈øoever pa≈ø≈øeth among≈øt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. You mu≈øt al≈øo be very carefull to u≈øe this faction very courteou≈øly, and to engage them by little and little into actions which may make them irreconcilable to their Prince. But when you ≈øee they make warre with re≈øpect, and that they will but by halves offend him from whom they have revolted, you mu≈øt have them in great ≈øu≈øpicion, and march with them with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in hand: for whether it be the fear of a ruine without recovery, or the hope of a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hindreth them from putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves upon reall extremities, the one and other are equally dangerous; and at la≈øt you may fear they may accommodate them≈øelves to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice: wherefore if they will not engage them≈øelves to do extraordinary and irremi≈ø≈øible actions at the beginning, you ought not to joyn with them but under good pledges: You mu≈øt al≈øo u≈øe ≈øuch as do voluntarily yield them≈øelves to you with all humanitie, clemencie, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, and ≈øuch as re≈øi≈øt you with all ≈øeveritie; for beneficence towards the one and ≈øeveritie towards the other are the two principall means which get you obedience.

gates of a dozen others: as on the other ≈øide, a town taken by force and ≈øpared, or which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it ≈øelf voluntarily and is evil intreated, ≈øhutteth a great many.

                     <p>TO treat of this ≈øubject well, we mu≈øt divide it into three parts; namely, into ≈ømall States, tho≈øe of a middle rank, and tho≈øe which are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈ø≈øant. The ≈ømall ones are of that nature as they ≈øub≈øi≈øt not but by the jealou≈øies which their neighbours have one of another; for that if one of them will a≈ø≈øail a weak State, the other will defend it: neverthele≈ø≈øe, it is but a tottering condition and ill a≈ø≈øured; for if the one findeth him≈øelf able enough to a≈ø≈øail them, the other will not find him≈øelf ≈øufficient to defend them. The coun≈øels of Princes and States are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes governed ≈øo equally, but for the mo≈øt part one prevaileth above the other. Be≈øides this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience there is yet another, that ≈øometimes they agree to divide the prey; ≈øo that ≈øuch kind of pettie States which have not ≈øtrength within them≈øelves for their own defen≈øe, are alwayes in perill; and they mu≈øt u≈øe very much pliant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe to remove all pretexts from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of undertaking ≈øomething again≈øt them. The onely means which they have is to have one or two towns exceeding well fortified, with arms and money enough to defend them well;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7521:90"/>
that ≈øo they may give lei≈øure to them which will not ≈øuffer the growth of him which ≈øhall a≈ø≈øail you, to aid you: for if you have no means at all to re≈øi≈øt, your countrey will be taken before they ≈øhall have time to a≈ø≈øi≈øt you: and be≈øides that, the happine≈ø≈øe which they conceive of conquering you giveth them a ≈øpur to a≈ø≈øail you; you ≈øhall find many more per≈øons di≈øpo≈øed to ≈øuccour you then to reconquer your countrey: for that the one is ea≈øie with equall forces, and the other without greater ≈øtrength is very difficult. To which I adde, that there is ofttimes as great danger that he which regaineth your countrey as your friend keep it not for him≈øelf, as well as he which had taken it as your enemy: or if he re≈øtore it to you, it will be with ≈øo hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as you ≈øhall po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe but the ≈øhadow of a Sovereigntie. And thrice happy are they which meet with ≈øo good and ≈øo generous Princes, which do ree≈øtabli≈øh them into their lo≈øt States, with the ≈øame authoritie and liberty as they po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed them before: for ≈øuch examples are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rare. Concerning tho≈øe States of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle condition, I propound a Prince (or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) which for his defen≈øe is able to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein an army of 20000 foot and 3000 hor≈øe with all nece≈ø≈øary equipage. If his countrey be of a difficult acce≈ø≈øe, and that there be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it but by certain pa≈ø≈øages and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains guarded and fortified, he hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: but they which too much do tru≈øt and re≈øt upon them, and have neglected other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen≈øes, have deceived them≈øelves, and have been lo≈øt by tho≈øe wayes wherein they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves mo≈øt a≈ø≈øured. If it be encompa≈ø≈øed by the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7521:91"/>
≈øea, it is a fair moat, notwith≈øtanding he which is ≈øtronger will find means to make his de≈øcent into the i≈øland. If it be environed with moori≈øh grounds and rivers, yet an enemy will find wayes to pa≈ø≈øe them, e≈øpecially when he hath artillery to favouri≈øe ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øages; in≈øomuch that the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt way is to tru≈øt to your own forces, namely a good army and good fortre≈ø≈øes: I ≈øay, both joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together: for that the army without fortre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes being weak, and not daring to hazard any thing, leaveth the victuall of the champain to the enemy, and ≈øo the means to ≈øub≈øi≈øt at your charge, and at la≈øt to ruine you. And fortre≈ø≈øes without an army are not able to pre≈øerve you longer then the time you have made your maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of victuall for, within them: but the≈øe things being proportioned with judgement, you may make a great re≈øi≈øtance. In the≈øe things you mu≈øt not ≈øuffer your ≈øelf to be led by the fan≈øies of the people, which without con≈øidering the ≈øituations of their towns, or the publick good, when they ≈øee their neighbours fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, will all imitate them; a thing equally dangerous, to have more fortre≈ø≈øes then you can guard, or to have none at all. Yet I ≈øhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the la≈øt then the fir≈øt: for that at lea≈øt by hazarding a battel you put your enemy to half the fear; but by the other way you mu≈øt ≈øurely peri≈øh, without being able to do any other thing but prolong your ruine: for the jealou≈øie which you have to pre≈øerve all your fortre≈ø≈øes by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great garri≈øons in them, hindreth you of the means of keeping an army in the field: and then the ≈øpoil of two or three harve≈øts compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you to yield your neck to the halter. I know
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7521:91"/>
there are ≈øome which ground them≈øelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this rea≈øon, That when all the principall places of a State be fortified, all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall of the champain may be drawn into them, ≈øo that an army coming thither, if it ≈øtayeth there, it dieth through famine; and if it doth but pa≈ø≈øe through, it doth no great hurt: in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible to make any great ≈øiege there. Whereunto I an≈øwer, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øes are principally invented for the weaker, that ≈øo a few men may re≈øi≈øt a great number: and if you have ≈øo great a number of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øes, and tho≈øe requiring great guards (as the great fortified towns do) you mu≈øt have a greater number of ≈øouldiers then he ≈øhall have which cometh to a≈ø≈øail you; otherwi≈øe you were not able to provide them all with ≈øufficient gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øons to pre≈øerve them from a ≈øiege. And if you be the ≈øtronger without any fortified place, you ≈øhall pre≈øerve your countrey in keeping the field. There is yet a further inconvenience in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of great towns; that is, that you make them ≈øo proud as they will not acknowledge their Sovereigne but upon good terms; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lea≈øt di≈øcommoditie they receive in any warre the inhabitants de≈øire rather to change their ma≈øter then to ≈øee their goods wa≈øted. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch that I conclude, that you ought to have ≈øo few fortre≈ø≈øes that they may not hinder you from keeping the field; that tho≈øe which you have be ≈øo well fortified and furni≈øhed with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as they may make a great re≈øi≈øtance; and to place them ≈øo well as they may bridle the great towns, and that they may a≈ø≈øure the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, that ≈øo the enemy may make difficultie to leave a place behind him which might di≈øcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7521:92"/>
his victuall, and that by intelligence or otherwi≈øe he may not ≈øei≈øe upon ≈øome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall town which may ≈øerve him for a ≈øeat to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein warre within the countrey. The≈øe things thus di≈øpo≈øed of, you mu≈øt regard what enemy a≈ø≈øaileth you. If it be a power of confederates united together, it is the more ea≈øie to di≈øunite, then when it dependeth on one alone: and in this ca≈øe it is exceeding good to cau≈øe ≈øome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to grow betwixt them, by feigning of intelligence with ≈øome one of the confederates, to whom ≈øhewing more re≈øpect and le≈ø≈øe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øitie, you may give jealou≈øie to the re≈øt: as al≈øo by procuring a diver≈øion upon the countrey of one of the re≈øt. It being a very difficult thing that many ≈øovereigne powers ≈øhould long hold a league together, without ≈øome di≈øgu≈øts to ari≈øe among≈øt them, or mi≈øtakings, envies, and even enmities, by rea≈øon of the diver≈øitie of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and intere≈øts; ≈øo that that power which onely dependeth upon one State onely, is much more to be feared. And becau≈øe you may be a≈ø≈øailed more or le≈ø≈øe fiercely, I mu≈øt ≈øay a word for that: If it be by forces which are not too much di≈øproportionable to yours, you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve your countrey without for≈øaking it, and with your army and fortre≈ø≈øes tie up the enemy, in hindring him from victuall; and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching alwayes ≈øo near him as you ≈øhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from making any ≈øiege of importance. For if a Conquerour advanceth not forward he recoileth; and it is impo≈ø≈øible for him to ≈øub≈øi≈øt in a countrey which he would conquer, if at fir≈øt he taketh no footing, and doth not ≈øtrengthen him≈øelf by ≈øome con≈øiderable pri≈øe. If al≈øo you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7521:92"/>
be a≈ø≈øailed by a power altogether di≈øproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to your forces; in this ca≈øe you mu≈øt leave the field, and burn all the victuall which you cannot contein within your fortre≈ø≈øes, and al≈øo all the towns and villages which you cannot guard: for it is better for you to pre≈øerve your ≈øelf in a ruined countrey, then to keep it for your enemy. And it is in this that a Prince, to gain, as he thinketh, the name of being compa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øionate towards his people (which in ≈øuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions turn their backs upon him) becometh cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el towards him≈øelf: But it is rather a vice of irre≈øolution and of weakne≈ø≈øe of courage which po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth us, then a true compa≈ø≈øion which we have of the misfortune of another: as that of the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> who upon the fir≈øt ill fortune that befell him (his forces being yet entire) dur≈øt not trie the hazard of a battel any more. And he who could not afford any pitie to <hi>Galba</hi> in his decrepit age (being his de≈øigned ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øour to the Empire) and which had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all kinds of villanies to attein it, would per≈øwade po≈øterity, that compa≈ø≈øion to ≈øee the <hi>Romane</hi> bloud ≈øhed had made him re≈øolve to e≈øtrange him≈øelf from it by killing him≈øelf. Thus it is that we oftentimes de≈øire to cover our vices with the vertue which is neare≈øt thereunto. But as it is a maxime, that no publick good can be without ≈øome prejudice to ≈øome particular men, ≈øo a Prince cannot di≈øintangle him≈øelf from a perilous enterpri≈øe, if he will plea≈øe every man. And the greate≈øt and mo≈øt u≈øuall faults which we commit in matters of State and war proceed from ≈øuffering our ≈øelves to be carried away with this complacencie, whereof we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7521:93"/>
us when there is no remedy left. But to avoid ≈øuch ≈øtorms you mu≈øt hold this for a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall law for your own pre≈øervation, Never to ≈øuffer that neighbour of yours to grow up which maketh him≈øelf the ≈øtronge≈øt: for it is better to offend him by hindring him from enabling him≈øelf to de≈øtroy you, then to ≈øuffer him to grow greater out of fear to offend him. It being a thing certain, that no man pre≈øerveth his libertie again≈øt a conquering enemy by comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but onely by force.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth that we ≈øpeak of pui≈ø≈øant States which (without help of another) have arms, money, and what el≈øe is needfull to maintein a continuall warre.</p>
                     <p>Of this kind there be but few, and they need to care for none but them≈øelves; for that one ≈øole enemy is not able to a≈ø≈øail them, and that it is hard for the leagues of ≈øeverall Princes all to agree in ≈øuch a de≈øigne, or for any long time to ≈øub≈øi≈øt together: Neverthele≈ø≈øe I will ≈øay a word on this ≈øubject. Great States are either compacted altogether, or ≈øpread abroad in ≈øeverall places: the fir≈øt, which have all their forces united, are able to a≈ø≈øail, and to defend them≈øelves more powerfully then they which are ≈øo ≈øeparated; becau≈øe they carry all their forces where need requireth with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and facilitie, and le≈ø≈øe charge: the other put a great part of the world into an alarm and jealou≈øie, becau≈øe they frontier upon the greate≈øt number of States. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, if the one or the other be a≈ø≈øailed, they mu≈øt make u≈øe of the defen≈øes we propounded before: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will ≈øay that they ought to have no fortre≈ø≈øes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7521:93"/>
but good ones, and few in number, and onely on the frontiers, and none within the heart of the countrey; for that having more cau≈øe to fear civil warres then forrein, and without which no man will ever a≈ø≈øail a great Empire, it is the way to take away the main root from them which maketh them to undertake the enterpri≈øe and to ≈øub≈øi≈øt. Be≈øides, you ought not to perpetuate any governments, neither to families, nor yet for life. But the principall and mo≈øt able remedy again≈øt civil warre is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein a forrein warre; which cha≈øeth away idlene≈ø≈øe, ≈øetteth all on work, and particularly giveth ≈øatisfaction to ambitious and ≈øtirring ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: it bani≈øheth luxurie, it maketh your people warlike, and mainteineth you in ≈øuch reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among≈øt your neighbours, as you are the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratour of all their differences. It is true that this maxime is not good to be ob≈øerved but by ≈øuch States as are of this la≈øt ≈øort. For as it is nece≈ø≈øary for them, I find it hurtfull for pettie States, which mu≈øt fear all ≈øorts of warre; for being too weak to gain by it, they run the hazard to be the pray of ≈øuch as are the ≈øtronger,</p>

                     <p>A Sovereigne Prince is more capable to make great and ready conque≈øts then a common-wealth; for that finding him≈øelf ≈øecret in his coun≈øel, courageous in his re≈øolution, ready in his execution, and not fearing to be contradicted by any, he maketh more conque≈øts in ten years of his life, then a common-wealth which is le≈ø≈øe ≈øecret, which is long in re≈øolving, which bridleth the authoritie of her Captains, and which every houre contradicteth their actions, ≈øhall be able to do in a hundred yeares: So al≈øo a common-wealth which goeth alwayes upon her own maximes, which is not ≈øubject to the want of one per≈øon, and who≈øe government receiveth no alteration by the death of any of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerveth much better and for a longer time that which ≈øhe hath conquered then a Prince; which ofttimes (and almo≈øt alwayes) hath a ≈øucce≈ø≈øour as much a heartle≈ø≈øe dullard as him≈øelf was ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, I will here e≈øtabli≈øh (as well for the one as for the other) the true maximes for the well a≈ø≈øuring of a conque≈øt: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt in two things; namely to take away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire of revolting from tho≈øe whom you have conquered, and the means of being able to do it.</p>
                     <p>For the fir≈øt, it is a thing very certain, that if you conquer a free people, you ≈øhall not take away (at lea≈øt during the life of tho≈øe which have lived ≈øo) their de≈øire to recover their liberty. If they be ≈øubjects to a Prince and a State, and that they have onely changed their ma≈øter, they will rather de≈øire to remain under the authoritie of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7521:94"/>
him which ≈øhall u≈øe them the mo≈øt courteou≈øly. Therefore you mu≈øt alwayes begin by a fair way, and to e≈øtabli≈øh a condition for them which you have conquered which may be ≈øure, both for their life and for their goods. For if even your own ≈øubjects find not this a≈ø≈øurance, it is to be feared they will revolt; how much more they which are newly conquered? it being a law of nature imprinted in every creature, that the meane≈øt and lea≈øt <hi>animal</hi> taketh care for its own con≈øervation; to which man endued with rea≈øon addeth the con≈øervation of his honour and his welfare, which he ofttimes preferreth before his own life. Therefore a Prince mu≈øt govern accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exact ju≈øtice, uphold the oppre≈ø≈øed in his due right, ab≈øtein from all violence him≈øelf, a≈øwel concerning the honour of their wives as for their goods: for without this it is impo≈ø≈øible to make a conquered people tractable. You mu≈øt al≈øo (≈øo much as may be) maintein them in the form of their government, &amp; exclude none of them out of the po≈ø≈øibility of atteining to tho≈øe offices, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and honours which they may po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to your ≈øafetie. And if it be a Prince which maketh this conque≈øt, the means to a≈ø≈øure him≈øelf well therein is there to e≈øtabli≈øh his re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the mo≈øt that may be; for that his pre≈øence doth hinder many di≈øorders, the ≈øplendour of his court imprinteth a certain veneration into the minds of the people, and it bringeth gain to the artificers and citizens where it is kept.</p>
                     <p>If it be a common-wealth which cannot change the ≈øeat of their government, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nece≈ø≈øary that ≈øuch as they ≈øhould ≈øend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to govern live there with ≈øplendour. For
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7521:95"/>
the people is ≈øometimes more taken with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance then realitie. The≈øe are the means which do in≈øen≈øibly in≈øinuate obedience into a newly conquered people: but becau≈øe this is not ≈øufficient, and that ofttimes the facilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting impunely cau≈øeth men to have a de≈øire to it, it is nece≈ø≈øary for you to precaution your ≈øelf by requi≈øite a≈ø≈øurances, which con≈øi≈øt in having their arms and fortre≈ø≈øes in your own hands: I mean not that all the people ≈øhall be wholy di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, for if it be po≈ø≈øible it mu≈øt not come to that; but to a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelf of great communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by good fortre≈ø≈øes; to have arcenals in ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts, and not all in one place; and not to leave any town or ca≈øtle (except your fortre≈ø≈øes of garri≈øon) ≈øo ≈øtrong as to be able to endure 100 cannon-bullets. There is a la≈øt means, whereof the ancients made a profitable u≈øe, and is now wholly left, which I do marvellou≈øly approve of; which is, to e≈øtabli≈øh colonies, and to tran≈øport the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from one countrey to another. For be≈øides that it is a great bridle to keep a conquered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in aw, you recompen≈øe by this means the nearer part of tho≈øe ≈øouldiers which have done you good ≈øervice. And I find not the rea≈øon to be ≈øufficient which ≈øome alledge, that it is cruelty to make this permutation, and that it is again≈øt charity; but to the contrary I find indeed tho≈øe remedies to be cruel which are commonly u≈øed, to keep the people ≈øo under as they have nothing but their life, and cannot hope for any honour within their own countrey. For my ≈øelf I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe freely, that I had rather be driven out of my countrey into another, where I ≈øhould have a hope for my ≈øelf and mine to be able to attein to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7521:95"/>
≈øomething more then now I am, then to remain in mine own countrey to be deprived of that hope; finding nothing to be ≈øo hard as to take away hope from a man, which is that which in this world, and for the goods of this world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him undertake all things; and which for the goods of the other world furni≈øheth him with con≈øtancy to ≈øuffer all things: Moreover, there is nothing which di≈øtingui≈øheth a man ≈øo much from a bea≈øt, nor yet a regenerate man from a ≈øen≈øuall, as hope. Which maketh me conclude, that you ≈øhould never take from a man the hope of being able to obtein a better condition then that which he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth, that ≈øo he be not ca≈øt into de≈øpair.</p>

                     <p>ONe of the mo≈øt honourable actions which a Prince doth, and which bringeth him mo≈øt reputation, is to ≈øuccour his allies in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities: but it is a thing which for the mo≈øt part is very difficult. When you will make war, you choo≈øe your advantages, and you take your time and your mea≈øures according to that which you can and will do: it is not ≈øo in the ≈øuccouring of your allie, which mu≈øt be a≈ø≈øi≈øted with ≈øuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and di≈øcommodities as you meet with. If his countrey be joyned to yours, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindreth you from a≈ø≈øi≈øting him with all your forces united, you cannot excu≈øe the not doing of it, unle≈ø≈øe it be that you fear his enemy, and would not offend him; which is an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and no judicious rea≈øon. For by this excu≈øe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7521:96"/>
you e≈øcape not the danger which your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours lo≈ø≈øe will draw upon you. It being much better for you to re≈øi≈øt joyntly, then ≈øuffer your ≈øelves to be undone one after another. But if it be an allie ≈øeparated from you by other Princes and States (which ofttimes ≈øo hapneth) and that you meet with great difficulties to get into his countrey, you mu≈øt then well con≈øider after what manner you ≈øhould ≈øuccour him: for if the States which are between you both refu≈øe you pa≈ø≈øage, and that you mu≈øt be enforced to give them bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel before you be able to a≈ø≈øi≈øt your allie, it is to be feared that you ≈øhall not be able to ≈øuccour him timely enough. And if your neighbour, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for fear of you, or of him which a≈ø≈øaileth your allie, do offer you pa≈ø≈øage, you cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof with ≈øafety, unle≈ø≈øe he put you in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe places which are nece≈ø≈øary to a≈ø≈øure your return; which being refu≈øed you, you mu≈øt go no further. But if the enemy of your ally hath territories near you, and ≈øuch as you may ea≈øily a≈ø≈øail; you mu≈øt do it ≈øtoutly; and that ≈øuccour which can be given by diver≈øion is (in my opinion) the ≈øure≈øt and that which ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth be≈øt; becau≈øe you do it with all your forces and conveniences, and ordinarily that countrey which you a≈ø≈øail is not well provided, becau≈øe he which a≈ø≈øaileth another State leadeth out with him the be≈øt Captains and ≈øouldiers which he hath. But if you want all the≈øe means, there is no other left but that of money, wherewith you may a≈ø≈øi≈øt him; which ofttimes is not ≈øufficient to ≈øave him.</p>

                        </gap> in per≈øon or by Lieutenants: for that the practice thereof being different, every man bringeth his be≈øt rea≈øons to maintein his opinion. They which di≈øapprove of his doing it in per≈øon alledge, that by going out of his territories he openeth the doore for di≈øorders, and robbeth him≈øelf of the means to prevent them; that it is more nece≈ø≈øary for him to keep peace within then to make war abroad, for which nothing can do ≈øo much good as his pre≈øence, which keepeth in aw the mo≈øt ≈øtirring ≈øpirits; that holding them which are within in obedience he may give the better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his affairs abroad; that there befall greater inconveniences and le≈ø≈øe remediable, when the Prince is ingaged in per≈øon out of his countrey, then when he is within it; that if he ≈øhall receive ≈øome check in his per≈øon being farre from his owne territories, tho≈øe bu≈øie heads are more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make innovations, every man emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth him≈øelf and ≈øhaketh off his obedience; if he be ≈ølain there, his ≈øubjects are affrighted, and his enemie is encouraged by it, and thence draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great advantages; if he be taken, that is ≈øtill wor≈øe; for none being able to declare him≈øelf Prince, and the great ones, de≈øiring to make their benefit of his calamity, put all affairs into ≈øuch a confu≈øion that nothing is done in the State with authoritie, becau≈øe they which ≈øei≈øe upon the government tyrannize over the other great

ones which might pretend the ≈øame, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times love rather to call in the common enemy then to obey their fellows. Whereunto they adde, that a Prince cannot free him≈øelf without giving great advantages to his enemy, which turn to a notable and irremediable prejudice both to him≈øelf and his State: So that all things being balanced, they conclude that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences are much greater of hazarding the per≈øon of the Prince in the warres then to cau≈øe them to be managed by his Lieutenants. This opinion is principally mainteined by men of the gown, naturall enemies to ≈øouldiers; who for that they can better pre≈øerve their authoritie in peace then war, do not onely di≈ø≈øwade from going in per≈øon to the warre, but even do advi≈øe the ≈øuffering of all ≈øorts of ignominy rather then to make war. Whereunto flatterers, panders, and all the plagues of Princes do adhere, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein them within their countrey in a lazine≈ø≈øe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> bringeth them to all ≈øorts of luxurie, making them believe that their States are but made for them, and not they for their States; that the taking of a maidenhead is more honourable then the conque≈øt of a Province; that there belongeth more indu≈øtry and trouble to the well-ordering of a fea≈øt then of a battel; that labour is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but onely for porters; and that great Kings ≈øhould cau≈øe all things to be acted without moving them≈øelves: which is the u≈øuall way of the lo≈ø≈øe of kingdomes and empires. They which coun≈øel a Prince to make warre in per≈øon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the command of an army is a mor≈øell ≈øo delicious that it ought not to be imparted to others without great nece≈ø≈øitie: for that to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7521:97"/>
a mans ≈øelf well in ≈øuch a charge, he mu≈øt be very ab≈øolute; and ofttimes the Generall of an army doth not contein him≈øelf within his dutie, e≈øpecially when the Prince performeth not his own. For in this ca≈øe he is naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of the glory of another, and cannot ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the good actions of his Lieutenant, though they tend to his own profit. In which humour they do entertein him which govern the affairs at court, with this fear, lea≈øt that an eminent vertue ≈øhould ≈øupplant them. And from hence proceedeth the infelicitie of the mo≈øt part of brave de≈øignes, how well ≈øoever undertaken, which are made to peri≈øh either for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or of victuall, or by re≈øtraining the authority of the Generall, or by putting officers upon him which oppo≈øe him, and which prove rather ≈øhackles to him then a≈ø≈øi≈øtants: and when affairs have not ≈øucceeded as men imagined, the fault is ca≈øt upon him which is innocent, and the blameworthy triumph: and thus great Princes ≈øhal be ≈øerved which make war by their Lieutenants: That the reputation of a Prince who is a good commander him≈øelf is much greater then a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which hath good commanders: that the fir≈øt is feared for his own worth, and the other onely through others: that the fir≈øt cannot betray him≈øelf, but that the commanders of the other may be corrupted: that the fir≈øt can make choice of ≈øuch as are fit for warre, and the other hath no good commanders but by hazard: that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the one is not ≈øo envied nor cro≈ø≈øed, ≈øeeing he is ma≈øter, and is to give account of his actions to no man; but that the Generall of the army of another is ≈øubject to a perpetuall jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7521:98"/>
and thrice happy is he that e≈øcapeth it: that the means to prevent civil warres is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the mo≈øt ≈øtirring and courageous ≈øpirits in forrein warres, where they ≈øhall find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ≈øatisfie their ambitions; as al≈øo to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes armed, becau≈øe that will cool tho≈øe which are hotte≈øt: and that the Prince be at the head of his army, that ≈øo none may u≈øe it again≈øt him. They alledge further, that never Prince hath founded a great Empire, but by making warre in per≈øon; nor hath lo≈øt any, but when he made warre by his Lieutenants. It is now left to the choice of Princes what is to be done upon the≈øe two advi≈øes. If he be a drone, which contenteth him≈øelf to be admired by his grooms, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no delight but in voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and which leaveth off the acting of the part of a King to act that of a ≈øcoundrel, he will never take that coun≈øel to command his armies him≈øelf. If he be a wi≈øe Prince, which loveth tranquillitie to maintein his people in ju≈øtice, neverthele≈ø≈øe he will not omit to be prepared for warre, and to inform him≈øelf therein, that ≈øo when occa≈øion ≈øhall ≈øerve he need not commit the command of his armies to others. But if he be a generous Prince which hunteth after glory, and de≈øireth to imitate tho≈øe great men which live ≈øtill 2000 years after their death, and who≈øe venerable names at this day do honor tho≈øe which mention them, he will doubtle≈ø≈øe choo≈øe for his principall imployment that of war; wherein he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to make him≈øelf expert, that ≈øo he need not depend upon others for the leading of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and will make that his chief delight. And this is the true plea≈øure which contenteth the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7521:98"/>
≈øpirit, which is particular to man, and common to great men: for corporall plea≈øure hath more of the bea≈øt then of man; and ≈øo he that wholly addicteth him≈øelf thereunto is wor≈øe then a brute bea≈øt.</p>

                     <p>IT is a thing which cannot be conceived, how available the reputation of a Generall of an armie is; and how hard it is to be pre≈øerved. For after that you have acquired the e≈øtimation of being a wi≈øe man, and of great managing, if you will con≈øerve it by prudence, men will ≈øay you are become a coward; and if by hazarding ≈øome battel you receive a check, they will hold you to be ra≈øh.

Neverthele≈ø≈øe ≈øo long as it la≈øteth it worketh marvellous effects: for when he hath gotten the name of being pro≈øperous in war, the ≈øouldiers believe that he cannot be beaten; and go upon his word ≈øo ≈øecurely to the combat, as they take no more knowledge of the danger; per≈øwading them≈øelves that he never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to fight, but that he is a≈ø≈øured of the victory: which doth ≈øo encourage them as they fight with much the more re≈øolution. Moreover, the enemies meeting with ≈øuch a man, fight not but in fear, as being a≈ø≈øured to be beaten. There be a thou≈øand of ancient and modern examples of this truth. When the army of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> (even when he was ab≈øent) was beaten, the <hi>Athenians</hi>
