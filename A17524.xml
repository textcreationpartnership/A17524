            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this effect (reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being taken) they take three years ſpace to make their preparations: In which time they furniſh themſelves with waggons and horſes of burden, taking order that all their countrey be imployed to all ſorts of grain to make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of victuall, and name <hi>Orgetorix</hi> to be their Generall and Conductour, who for his part imployeth that time in fortifying himſelf by the aſſiſtance of his neighbours,<note place="margin">Sequanus.</note> perſwadeth <hi>Caſticus</hi> a <hi>Burgundian</hi> to make himſelf Lord of his countrey as his father had been,<note place="margin">Aeduus.</note> draweth in <hi>Dumnorix</hi> of <hi>Autun,</hi> brother to <hi>Divitiacus</hi> to the ſame deſigne, the moſt powerfull man of his citie, and giveth him his daughter in marriage.

bring them under ſubjection, ſeiſed on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and during the conteſtations about his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (having a great train of kinsfolks and partakers) he died in priſon. This abated not the deſigne of this people; which on their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day having taken as much victuall as would ſerve them for three moneths, burnt the reſt of their corn, and all their cities to the number of twelve, and 4. hundred villages, and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thoſe of <hi>Baſil,</hi>

After that, having learned that the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at the foot of a hill, he cauſeth it to be viewed, and finding it to be of eaſie acceſſe, he ſendeth <hi>Labienus</hi> thither (cauſing him to march all night) to gain the top of the hill: and in the morning, having put his forces into bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, he diſpatcheth <hi>Conſidius</hi> to diſcover; who, having taken the allarm of <hi>Labienus,</hi> returneth to <hi>Ceſar</hi> that the enemy had ſeiſed the top of the hill, which ſtayed him that day from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the <hi>Suiſſes.</hi> The day following he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the way of <hi>Beaulne</hi> to diſtribute corn to his armie: which the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> perceiving,<note place="margin">Bibracte.</note> follow him. <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſeeing them coming poſſeſſeth himſelf of a hill, embattelleth his army about the middle of the deſcent, &amp; on the top he quartereth two new levied legions and all the baggage, alighteth and ſendeth away his horſe, and cauſeth all the reſt to do the like, to ſhew them that they muſt overcome or die.

                     <p>THe reſolution of this people, which ſeemeth to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and which for the bad ſucceſſe is univerſally condemned, hath nevertheleſſe the ſame principles which all Conquerours have, namely, the deſire of command and enlarging themſelves: and they are remarkable in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast of three yeares preparation, in their conſtancie for not deficting from their deſigne after the death of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and in the execution thereof, burning their goods and houſes to the end they might leave themſelves no hope of ſafetie, but onely in the ſharpneſſe of their ſwords. Whence we may gather, that we ought not to undertake any great deſigne timorouſly, nor to look to the means of eſcape but rather of overcoming. For if in the beginning of a dangerous deſigne you make known a way of eſcape, the impatience or naturall timorouſneſſe of men maketh them find out that way upon the leaſt accident that befalleth. And if the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> had not met with the incomparable virtue of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who by his valour, industrie, diligence and good fortune ſtayed their furie, they might have atteined the ſcope of their enterpriſes.</p>
                     <p>In the managing of his warre <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath ſhewed (as in all other) that that which hath made him fortunate in his exploits hath principally been his invariable order of encamping ſtrongly, alwayes entrenching himſelf, that ſo he might never be compelled to fight but when he pleaſed, and that he might lay hold on ſuch occaſions as offered themſelves to defeat his enemies; alſo his providence in taking care that his proviſion of victuall failed not; and his continuall keeping of his ſouldiers in exerciſe and in breath, to make them able to execute his deſignes readily and in good order.</p>
                     <p>The pardon of <hi>Dumnorix</hi> is obſervable: his naturall clemency induced him to it, ſuffering himſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the intreaties of his brother <hi>Divitiacus</hi> whom he loved: Nevertheleſſe he cauſed heed to be taken to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, that ſo he might receive no new inconveniences by him afterward.</p>
                     <p>The errour of <hi>Conſidius</hi> ſheweth how much it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſend men of experience to diſcover an army: And the commanding of the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> to return and reinhabite their countrie was an act of prudence, thereby hindering

                     <p>THe ſubject of the ſecond warre was this: The diviſion of the <hi>Auvergnats</hi> and <hi>Autu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> puiſſant people in <hi>Gallia</hi> had called in the <hi>Germanes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Averni &amp; Aedui.</note> by the help of which the firſt had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the other; nevertheleſſe they all found themſelves oppreſſed, and the conquerours much more then the conquered: for theſe were diſcharged for ſome tribute and hoſtages, and from the other the <hi>Germans</hi> took away the greateſt part of their lands, inſomuch that all ſeeing themſelves ſubdued, they hold an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of States by the permiſſion of <hi>Ceſar</hi> to deſire his aid, which he promiſeth. But having ſent to <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> the Generall of the <hi>Germanes,</hi> to this end, he received replies ſo inſolent, that at laſt they fell fowl; where <hi>Ceſar</hi> defeated him, and chaced both him and all the <hi>Germanes</hi> out of <hi>Gallia,</hi> forcing them to paſſe the <hi>Rhine</hi> again.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two wars were finiſhed in one ſummer.</p>
                     <div type="observations">

                        <p>VVHereby we may obſerve how dangerous ſuch auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarie ſuccours are, eſpecially when you require them of a people more powerfull then your own. <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath indeed driven out <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> but the <hi>Gauls</hi> have done nothing but changed maiſter. He imbarked himſelf in this war for two reaſons: the firſt, becauſe be ſuſpected that this puiſſant nation, taking footing in <hi>Gallia,</hi> might come to gain upon <hi>Provence,</hi> and ſo draw near to <hi>Italy;</hi> and the other, that thereby he inſinuated himſelf inſenſibly into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the ſaid <hi>Gauls.</hi> Which buſineſſe he managed ſo dextrouſly by enterteining their diviſions amongſt them,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7521:7"/>
that by the aid of the one he conquered the other, and in the end ſubdued all.</p>
                        <p>We muſt further obſerve his diligence (ſo much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in all his actions) to poſſeſſe himſelf of <hi>Beſancon,</hi> having prevented his enemies, and by this means provided for the nouriſhment of his armie. There it was that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike fear ſeiſed upon his ſouldiers, which began by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers: who deſiring to depart diſcouraged the reſt, that ſo they might cover their own ſhame by the generall delinquencie of the armie: which is a moſt dangerous thing, and whereof a Generall of an army ought to take extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care, never to hazard any battel untill he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſouldiers ſpirits again; which <hi>Ceſar</hi> did at this time by making an oration to them, wherein he excelled. He further helped himſelf (as many other commanders, eſpecially <hi>Marius</hi>) by encamping ſtrongly before this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible armie, and making his ſouldiers know by ſmall skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes that their enemies were not invincible nor more valiant then themſelves; and cauſing them to conceive that joyning order and militarie diſcipline to the prudence of their Generall, they were their ſuperiours. For the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> have never conquered other nations by their great number, nor by their valour, but by their knowledge in warre, (which they alwayes exerciſed) by the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their order, and entrenchment of their camp. Whereupon we must conſider that <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> being encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between <hi>Ceſar</hi> and the place from whence he had his victuall, and that <hi>Ceſar</hi> not being able to draw him to battel in five dayes, after that he had well fortified that camp be goeth with all his army in battaglia to fortifie a ſmall one, in a place of advantage, two miles diſtant from the first, and which favoured the way for his victuall, making the third part of his army to work whilest the other two thirds ſtood in battaglia, which repulſed the troups which <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> ſent to hinder the ſaid fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which being made he leaveth two legions there, and leadeth away the rest into his old camp. The next day <hi>Ceſar</hi> putteth himſelf into battaglia between the two camps, but being retired, <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> aſſaulteth the ſmall one, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed. <hi>Ceſar</hi> having thus reconfirmed the courages of his ſouldiers, ſallieth out with his whole armie in battaglia, and goeth up to the very trenches of <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> provoketh him to fight; who ſallieth out, and is defeated.</p>

The principall cauſes were, that, ſeeing the reſt of the <hi>Gaules</hi> in peace with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they feared an aſſault; beſides they were ſolicited by certain <hi>Gauls</hi> diſcontented, or ambitious: the one of which took as little pleaſure to ſee the <hi>Romanes</hi> as <hi>Germanes</hi> in their countrey; and the other apprehenſive that during their abode they ſhould not be able to poſſeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any principalitie or dominion.

                        <p>VVE muſt here obſerve the judgement of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who by his diligence aſſured himſelf of thoſe of <hi>Rhems,</hi> by his induſtrie and affabilitie held them faithfull, and by his foreſight prepared a diverſion against thoſe of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois,</hi> (a bold and ſtout people) which redounded much to his profit. Further it is to be conſidered that an army of thirtie or fourtie thouſand men trained and well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, is able (with patience well intrenching and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping it ſelf) to diſcomfit the moſt numerous armies, which for want of victuall deſtroy themſelves; and if they fight (provided that you avoid being ſurrounded on all parts) their diſorders and confuſion will alſo break them. The warres of the <hi>Romanes</hi> do prove this true; who have never defeated their enemies but with leſſer number; nor were ever forced to ſallie out of their retrenched camp, to give battel againſt their wills: and particularly this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, wherein <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath had more to do againſt one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:7521:8"/>The firſt, That thoſe of <hi>Tournay</hi> being advertiſed that <hi>Ceſar</hi> cauſed every Legion to march with its baggage after it, they reſolved to lay an Embuſcado and to fight with them, truly judging that the baggage ſeparating the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in an incloſed countrey, they ſhould not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve each other, and that otherwiſe they might (with all their forces) ſet upon each Legion apart.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, That they found themſelves deceived in their preſuppoſition; becauſe that though <hi>Ceſar</hi> commanded his army to march ſo in a countrey of ſecuritie for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſneſſe thereof; nevertheleſſe when he was in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected countrey, he cauſed ſix Legions to march together, then all the baggage, and in the rear of that two Legions newly levied. And it was in this order, and upon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping, when they charged him.</p>
                        <p>The third is the confeſſion of <hi>Ceſar:</hi> who freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that his armie was aſſaulted ſo unexſpectedly and couragiouſly, and in a countrey ſo incloſed, that it was neither his cuſtomary order which ſaved him (for he had no leiſure to embattel) nor his exhortations, nor his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in all parts (for he was forced to fight in the place he then was in) but he attributed the ſafetie thereof onely to the continued diſcipline of his ſouldiers, which knew of themſelves to range where they ought, &amp; to that that he ever made all his officers exactly obſerve the performance of their duties, whilest the intrenchment of the camp was a making; ſo that in all parts were found ſome ready to command, and others to obey; which made good the reſiſtance, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the affrightment.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, That a raſh reſolution is oftentimes to be feared; and to avoid it, muſt never be omitted whatſoever dependeth on military diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>And the fifth, That the treaſon which thoſe of <hi>Bolduc</hi> (whom he had beſieged in the beſt of their fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) would have committed against him after they had yielded themſelves,<note place="margin">Aduatici.</note> ſhould teach us that we ſhould alwaies diſtrust an enemy, and keep our ſelves ſo much the more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our guards, the nearer we are to overcome.</p>

So that he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſaulted on all parts, before he had leiſure to underſtand the danger he was in; and finding his affairs in great extremitie, having neither victuall to ſubſiſt nor men to make a long reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, deſpair made him follow the counſel of <hi>Publ us Sextius Baculus</hi> firſt Centurion of that Cohort,<note place="margin">Tribunus.</note> and of <hi>Caius Voluſenus</hi> Colonel of a thouſand men, which was to ſally out from all

parts upon the enemy: which they did ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that they which thought they were not able to defend themſelves in their trenches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them in open field.

                     <p>But the occaſion of the fourth warre was this. <hi>Publius Craſſus</hi> one of <hi>Ceſars</hi> Lieutenants having ſent divers Tribunes to make proviſion of corn neceſſary for the feeding of his army, into the countreyes of <hi>Perche, Cornoaille,</hi> and <hi>Vannes;</hi>

By this example their neighbours did the like, and all ſent word to <hi>Craſſus</hi> that they would not deliver them up unleſſe he reſtored their hoſtages. <hi>Ceſar,</hi> having heard of this combination, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth diligently for a warre, truly conſidering that if he ſuffered this he ſhould open a gap to a generall revolt; for he well knew the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the French to take arms, loving their libertie and abhorring ſervitude. He provideth in the firſt place to hinder the increaſing of the league; to this end he ſendeth <hi>Labienus</hi> into the countrey of <hi>Triers</hi> with the cavalrie,<note place="margin">Trevori.</note> giving him order to viſit thoſe of <hi>Rhems</hi> and the <hi>Belgae;</hi>

Their countrey is maritime, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult approch, and ſtrong in ſhipping; inſomuch that when with much labour he had brought a

place to the extremitie of being taken, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants imbarked themſelves with their goods, and removed to another: ſo that what he did was little worth, untill his navie being arrived he gave them battel, and defeated them: after which they yielded themſelves to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who put to death all the <hi>Senate,</hi> and cauſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſold. At the ſame time the Lieutenants which <hi>Ceſar</hi> had diſtributed amongſt the <hi>Gauls</hi> had their hands full: <hi>Q. Titurius Sabinus</hi> was ſet upon by <hi>Viridonix,</hi> commander of ſeverall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with ſtrong forces; but by his patience and ſubtiltie he drew him on to aſſault him in his camp, and overcame him; which reaſſured all that countrey. <hi>P.

                        <p>SO ended this warre: where we will obſerve firſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe of the intrenchments of camps, which in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire countreys ſerve for a bridle, as citadels to cities; the <hi>Romanes</hi> having never been able to have held ſo many conquered States under their obedience, but onely by that means: For armies garriſoned in ſever all towns may by being ſo ſeparated be defeated totally, or in part, by conſpiracie; beſides, the delicacies of cities do overthrow all militarie diſcipline, and abaſe all generous courage. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever if there be more fortreſſes then can well be maintein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you must demoliſh them, to the end that nothing may be able to reſiſt the armie: which being always in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body, oppoſeth it ſelf againſt all combinings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours; it being most certain, that not onely for the keeping reliefs out of a conquered Province, but alſo for the conſervation of your countrey againſt greater forces then your own (giving order that there be no want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall) it is to be done by intrenching ſtrongly: for whoſoever putteth himſelf wholly upon the defenſive, and ſhutteth himſelf up in walled towns, muſt in time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily periſh, unleſſe he receiveth forreign reliefs: for that by two or three yeares ſpoil of the increaſe of the champains the cities muſt of neceſſitie ſtarve, and thereby know your inabilitie to preſerve them; ſo that they will rather yield to your enemy then periſh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:7521:11"/>In the ſecond place we will conſider how <hi>Craſſus</hi> was put to it, when he had to do with commanders which had been trained under <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and which (according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romanes</hi>) could make benefit of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of grounds, fortifie their camp, and cut off their enemies victuall: for by ſuch a manner of warring they had brought the ſaid <hi>Craſſus</hi> to ſuch a paſſe that he was conſtrained to aſſault their camp; which albeit he forced (whether by having better ſouldiers, or by finding ſome part of it ill fortified) yet it is certain that he undertook that task out of deſpair rather then judgement, as being in danger to periſh for want of victuals.</p>
                        <p>We will further obſerve that <hi>Ceſar</hi> in all theſe actions by no diverſitie of making warre was ever astoniſhed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were aſſaulted in open field or in his camp, whether ſurpriſed, or whether his enemie retired into places inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible; alwayes finding them out in all places, and that without omitting one onely point of militarie diſcipline. For though our enemies ſometime do actions which have ſhew of fear, the better to circumvent us; yet muſt we not therefore diſeſteem them: no profeſſion being like to that of a ſouldier, wherein one fault can never be repaired, and wherein one houre cauſeth the loſſe of that reputation which hath been thirtie yeares acquiring.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this diſcourſe I will onely adde this, That the crueltie which <hi>Ceſar</hi> uſed towards thoſe of <hi>Vannes</hi> ought not to blemiſh his clemencie manifeſted in the whole courſe of his life; but we must rather believe that he forced his diſpoſition in this ſevere action to chaſtiſe the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the law of nations, in that they impriſoned thoſe which (under promiſe of ſafetie) went to negotiate with them; and alſo to give a terrour to all that people ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to revolt, by letting them taſt the ſweetneſſe of a mild government while they kept within the lists of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by uſing them rigourouſly when they departed from it.</p>

                        <p>Next we muſt conſider, that upon the fame of this great defeat he cauſed the <hi>Romane</hi> Eagles to flie on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to ſtrike a terrour into the <hi>Germanes,</hi> and be a means to retein them for the future from further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting: Beſides, he would not paſſe over the <hi>Rhine</hi> by boats, as a thing too full of hazard, but he made a bridge, which he cauſed to be fortified and guarded on both ſides of the river: neither ſtayed be longer in that countrey then was neceſſary for the reputation of his armie; and at his return brake down his bridge, taking away by that courſe the means from the <hi>Germanes</hi> of making uſe thereof.</p>

                        <p>IN this warre <hi>Ceſar</hi> had no great reſiſtance, all fleeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, having nothing to do but to pillage and burn the countrey; notwithstanding there be very good obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made thereupon: for though you learn not hence how to fight a battel, or to expugne fortreſſes, yet you may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7521:17"/>
here learn how to deal with ſuch as ſave themſelves by flight and by retiring into inacceſſible places: wherein many Commanders have failed for the not obſerving of three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall things, which <hi>Ceſar</hi> did: Firſt, to prevent the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by ſuch extraordinary diligence, as to ſurpriſe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be able to retire themſelves or their victuall into the forrests; ſo that by this means you may conſtrain the one to yield, and the other to periſh through famine.

And the laſt is, to hinder the ſouldiers from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding when they go to pillage, for fear they be cut off by the enemies. By which overſight many great inconveniences have often befallen conquering armies; which ſhould teach us never to ſlacken the ſeverity of military diſcipline, though we believe our ſelves far from an enemie, and in great ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The example we have in this book of <hi>Q.

Here we may obſerve how ingenious ſear is to ſeek out ſubjects to augment it ſelf; for becauſe this place was the ſame where <hi>Titurius</hi> and <hi>Cotta</hi> had been defeated the yeare before, they took it for an ill omen.</p>
                        <p>Let us further obſerve, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> (when he would make an expedition for ſeven or eight dayes, wh re was diligence required) diſcharged himſelf of his baggage, which in truth is a marvellous impediment in a champain; &amp; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conduct an army well, if (according to occaſions) you do not ſtrongly intrench your camp, or march without baggage.</p>
                        <p>Let us alſo admire the good intelligence <hi>Ceſar</hi> had by ſpies; a thing of ſuch utilitie, as that a Prince or Generall ought to ſpare no coſt for, it being the moſt powerfull means to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake

brave deſignes, and to avoid great ruines.</p>
                        <p>Neither must we forget his dexterity in dividing thoſe which were entring into a combination againſt him, and his aſſaulting them ſeverally, nor his customary d ligence in ſurpriſing them; having atteined to the end of the most part of his great deſignes by theſe wayes.</p>
                        <p>We will conclude the obſervations of this book with the ſtratageme of <hi>Labienus:</hi> who, deſirous to fight with thoſe of <hi>Triers</hi> before the <hi>G rmanes</hi> were joyned to them, reſolved to make it publickly believed that he was afraid of them, and that he would retreat; knowing right well that there were <hi>Gauls</hi> in his own army which would diſcover it to them; and in the mean time gave order ſecretly to retreat with a great noiſe, &amp; making ſhew of much fear: whereof they of <hi>Triers</hi> having intelligence, without ſtaying for the <hi>Germanes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they ought not to let ſlip the occaſion which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf unto them, paſſed the river, and came diſorderly as to an aſſured victory: but <hi>Labienus</hi> turneth upon them in good order, and defeateth them.

                        <p>ALl <hi>Ceſars</hi> other warres in <hi>Gallia</hi> have been made by divided parts, having made uſe of their diviſions to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine them; but this, by a generall conſent of almost all: they choſe one ſupreme Commander, great in prudence &amp; courage, who, well perceiving that the good diſcipline of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> and their knowledge in the art military, made them invincible by way of battels, changed his own way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre againſt them, and by prolonging time without hazarding a generall battel, finding himſelf ſuperiour in horſe, and the countrey to friend, not ready to ſupply their armies with victuall, made juſt account to have ruined them: whereupon we may make very good obſervations.</p>
                        <p>First, upon <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> who having been by a generall conſent choſen Generall of divers States (which had emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one towards another) hath known ſo well how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, that what adverſitie ſoever he met with in his affairs, he hath alwayes mainteined himſelf in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and aw amongst them; not ſparing to be ſevere where occaſion required (fear being the most powerfull means to keep men in order:) ill ſucceſſes never being able to deject him or diminiſh his confidence. Even at that time when he was accuſed to have had intelligence with the enemy, he ſo boldly defended himſelf by an oration, that he came off more authoriſed then before. Alſo it is an efficacious means to continue ſeverall people in a fair obſequencie, to parle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with them upon ſuch affairs as happen. He had the power to make them ſet fire on above twenty cities to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their enemies, which argued his great judgement,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7521:20"/>
for it was the onely way to have overcome the <hi>Romanes</hi> (ſtronger then they in battel) to have fought with them by famine. And in ſuch affairs all moderate counſels, or but half executed, are ruinous: as the taking of <hi>Bourges</hi> ſerveth us for a memorable example, for the ſaving of it from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſerved it for the benefit of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> which (by taking thereof) found therein ſuch commodious things as they ſtood in need of. His great credit is very remarkable: for to a free people at the beginning of a warre, before they had taſted of bad ſucceſſe, and in their hope to be able to overcome without being driven to ſo ſmart remedies, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth with them to fire their houſes and goods, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof warre is for the moſt part made. It was a very hard enterpriſe, for that the loſſe of things certain and preſent which we ſee and feel, is preferrable (with the ignorant) to things whereof the events are uncertain, and the benefits remote; and no man can well apprehend this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that hath not experimented it in the government of the people. He hath beſides ſhewed his conſtancy even to the end, and made no ſcruple (being the chief of ſo many ſeverall nations) to be ſhut up in a citie, where he did all that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and brave Generall ought to do, and hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted hunger and the diſcommodities of a ſiege, having held out even untill his relief was repulſed and defeated; but becauſe hiſtories make not but for the victorious, we ſee uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally none had in esteem but the ſonnes of fortune.</p>
                        <p>Now let us examine <hi>Ceſars</hi> carriage in this warre, which brake out he being in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the depth of winter, his army diſperſed in ſeverall countreys, far diſtant from each other, and the revolted States ſo in his way, as it was almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to unite his legions. In ſo great difficulties he findeth no other means but to ſurmount them by incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable labour, wherewith he maketh way over the mountains covered ſix foot thick with ſnow, and affrighteth his enemies more appearing in the middeſt of them (when they believed him ſtill in <hi>Italy</hi> and out of poſsibility to get to them) then by his great forces. He alſo added to this aſtoniſhment by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, cauſing his cavalry to ſhew it ſelf in ſeverall places at one and the ſame time, to cauſe a belief that he was very powerfull.</p>
                        <p>Let us further conſider that <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſeeing the faſhion of the warre changed, and that the enemy avoided battel, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to ſieges, wherein he ſheweth himſelf no leſſe a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7521:21"/>
maſter then in his other actions of warre. For all that which the moſt excellent modern Generalls put in practice, is drawn from his actions: and whatſoever we admire of <hi>Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, Breda,</hi>

                           <hi>Bolduc,</hi> and many other ſieges of the late Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> (who hath ſurpaſſed all others in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is infinitely inferiour to the two circumvallations of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexia,</hi> where the industry, the labour, and the ſhort time in which they were finiſhed, farre exceedeth all that hath been done elſewhere. I am not ignorant that the invention of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and of artillery hath changed the manner of fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of aſſaults, and of the defenſe of towns; but not in ſuch ſort, but that the principall foundations whereupon they are eſtabliſhed are particularly taken from <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who in that hath far ſurpaſſed all the <hi>Romane</hi> Generalls.</p>
                        <p>He is alſo admirable in his inventions and ſtratagemes, &amp; in the undauntedneſſe of his enterpriſes, who when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an aſſault upon the trenches which were about <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> he put a jealouſie into them by a body which he made of the horſe-boyes and baggages of the camp, which he cauſed to march in their ſight towards that part which he meant not to aſſault, but not at ſo near a diſtance that they might diſcover what kind of people they were; and having laid a legion in embuſcado in the night-time, and cauſed ſome ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouldiers to convey themſelves into the little camp which was nearer to the town, he aſſaulteth them ſo at unawares that he made himſelf master of all their trenches.</p>
                        <p>When he would have paſſed the river of <hi>Alliers,</hi> which <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> attempted to oppoſe, he cauſed ſome legions to lie in ambuſh near to a bridge which had been broken, and with the reſt of the army (which he made ſhew as if it had been intire) he paſſeth along the river, as if he had ſought ſome other paſſage, by which means he ſo deluded the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as that he cauſed the bridge to be repaired before it could be taken notice of, and ſo paſſed over without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> (in the time of the ſiege of <hi>Burges</hi>) was gone out with his cavalry, he departed by night, and went and aſſaulted his infantery within the camp, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little of defeating it.</p>
                        <p>When at the ſiege of <hi>Clermont</hi> he underſtood of the revolt of ten thouſand <hi>Autunois</hi> which came to his relief, he taketh foure legions, marcheth day and night to overtake them: which he doth, and took them all, and returneth time enough
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7521:21"/>
to defend his camp, which was aſſailed by <hi>Vercingetorix.</hi> Whereby we may obſerve by the way the benefit of having a camp alwayes well fortified, to the end we may be ever in a readineſſe to attempt upon the enemy as occaſions ſhall offer themſelves.</p>
                        <p>I cannot forget his great modesty. <hi>Comius</hi> (whom he had favoured, raiſed to wealth &amp; honour, and on whom he much truſted) he rather excuſeth then blameth for revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; alledging that he was forced to comply with the generall reſolution for recovering the liberty and glory of all <hi>Gallia.</hi>

                     </gap> after a long fight (whereof either of them made advantage) both the one and the other retreated into their camp. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, the continuall rain carried away both theſe bridges, and made the river altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unpaſſable, which drave him to extreme neceſſities, not being able to ſupply himſelf with victuall, nor receive thoſe new forces which came to him out of <hi>Gallia,</hi> nor repair his bridges by reaſon of the violence of the waters, and the hindrance which his enemies gave him, which were on the other ſide of the river: At laſt he cauſed boats to be made, and whileſt the <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peians</hi> buſied themſelves to entrap certain <hi>Gauls</hi> which came to joyn with him, he carrieth boats on wagons twentie miles from his camp, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them into the river, cauſeth ſome ſouldiers to paſſe over to the other ſide, and without loſing time conveyeth thither two legions more, by favour whereof he maketh his bridge: and by that means recovereth his way, and ſafe paſſage for his victuall, and receiveth thoſe troups which came to relieve him. This acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſſured his army, aſtoniſhed the enemy, and gave ſo much reputation to his affairs (with the news which he received at the ſame time,

                     <p>IT is a most dangerous thing for a people, a Generall of an army, or an army it ſelf, to be ſurpriſed with fear for that it is alwayes ſeconded with perverſe and ruinous accidents: which all Leaders and Commanders of armies ought to foreſee and carefully to prevent. There be three not able examples in this book on this ſubject; The firſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7521:25"/>
when <hi>Ceſar</hi> paſſed the <hi>Rubicon;</hi> for before that they declared him enemy to the weal-publick. <hi>Pompey</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh with a ſtamp with his foot to raiſe an armie to him; that at his approch <hi>Ceſars</hi> own ſouldiers ſhall deliver their Generall into his hands; neither doth he think him worthie conſideration; ſuch as dare but name <hi>Ceſar</hi> are driven out of <hi>Rome;</hi> briefly, he is proceeded againſt as a criminall offender. Notwithstanding ſo ſoon as he had but ſet the firſt ſtep to declare the warre, and though he did the ſame at <hi>Pezaro</hi> which he did at <hi>Rimini,</hi> having not the fourth part of his armie, every man was amazed; <hi>Pompey</hi> and the <hi>Conſuls</hi> betake them to their heels; the care of leavying of ſouldiers is caſt aſide, and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf abandoned. The cauſes of this great change proceeded from this, that <hi>Pompey</hi> never imagined that <hi>Ceſar</hi> durſt have undertaken ſo high a deſigne; grounding upon a preſumption which his vertues and good fortune had added unto him; which made him rather thoughtfull how to maintein his partie in the citie, then provide for defenſe thereof: Inſomuch that when he ſaw things go other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he had publiſhed, he ſtood amaſed. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no great wonder if an ignorant people (which toke aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance or fear from the good or bad countenance of him into whoſe protection they had delivered themſelves) did the like. Whereupon I will ſay, that in affairs of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance we ought (in imitation of <hi>Ceſar</hi>) before we enter into them, to conſider maturely the worſt that can befall, ſo that evil ſucceſſe diſmayeth us not; but when we are imbarked, we muſt not check at whatſoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, but with constancie go on to the end.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond example is, when <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of hope of being relieved by <hi>Pompey</hi>) took a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to ſave himſelf within <hi>Corfinium,</hi> where he was beſieged: but for that his countenance was ſadder then uſuall, his ſpeeches leſſe reſolute then the time required, and by ſome neglect of the neceſſary works for the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe, he diſcovered to his ſouldiers that which he would have concealed from them, ſo that (preventing his flight they delivered him unto <hi>Ceſar.</hi> It is a fair leſſon for a commander, to teach him that in greatest danger he ought to ſhew moſt reſolution; for his ſouldiers become courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or fearfull according to that they obſerve in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7521:26"/>The third is, when <hi>Ceſar</hi> diſcovered the fear of <hi>Afra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> ſouldiers, in that they ſeconded not each other, that they ſcarcely had received the brunt of the cavalrie but their enſignes were all on a heap, that they made not good their ranks nor distances, and that they ſtirred not from the field of battel where they could not ſubſiſt for want of water. And howſoever in theſe times armies approch not ſo near each other as then they did, by reaſon of the canon; nevertheleſſe, experimented Captains will make profitable uſe of ſuch judgements. I have ſeen <hi>Henry</hi> the Great chaſe eight hundred horſe with leſſe then two hundred; judging they would not dare to combat him becauſe of their confuſion and not obſerving diſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which fell out as he had foretold it.</p>
                     <p>And howſoever to retreat from a beſieged citie by a port of the ſea ſeemeth to be no very hard matter, nevertheleſſe the precautions which <hi>Pompey</hi> uſed to retire himſelf into <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> was that which ſaved him. For having to do with a people which he abandoned, and an enemy vigilant, he had been lost if he had not walled up the gates and barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed up all the entries into <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> except onely two (which were covert enough) by which his men iſſued to the haven; becauſe when his laſt men departed from the walls, the inhabitants at the ſame inſtant of time cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thoſe of <hi>Ceſars</hi> to mount them; for which reaſon in all kinds of retreats a captain cannot take too much care t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> make it ſafe and orderly: and though he may do it whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he pleaſeth himſelf, yet muſt he do it in ſo good time an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſo readily as that he be not engaged to fight. In this place I will relate a diſpute between <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius;</hi> the one being for retreat by night, the other by day: They which were for the night alledged that they ſhould gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the mountains and places of ſafetie before they ſhould be diſcovered: but the others judged that having to do with <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and he ſtrong in cavalrie, they ſhould never be able to get off from him without fighting, and in ſuch a caſe the day was to be preferred to the night, which alwayes cauſeth diſorders in retreats; which opinion prevailed, but not at all to their advantage. For my part I hold the other opinion the better: for beſides that it is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to retreat in the day time, in the preſence of an enemy; a well adviſed Captain will never engage himſelf to purſue an army by night; for that it is hard for him to prevent falling into an ambuſh.</p>

                  <p>WHileſt things paſſed thus in <hi>Spain, Caius Trebonius</hi> continueth the ſiege of <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> to the relief whereof <hi>Pompey</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>L.

The loſſe fell upon the <hi>Marſeillians,</hi> becauſe they fought more obſtinately then the reſt, as being more intereſſed, having to conſerve both goods and libertie; and that which afflicted them moſt was, that they had conceived too great hope of deliverance; howſoever they forbare not to continue a reſolute reſiſtance. Nevertheleſſe, the induſtry of <hi>Trebonius</hi> was ſuch, that with mantilets and other engines he approched a Towre, which he ſapped,<note place="margin">Vincae.</note> and overthrew part of it: which ſo affrighted the <hi>Marſeillians,</hi> as they promiſed to yield themſelves ſo ſoon as <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſhould return, and deſired a truce till then: <hi>Trebonius</hi> granteth it; whoſe ſouldiers negligent of their guard upon confidence of the truce, on a very windy day the <hi>Marſeillians</hi> make a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſalley, and burn all the engines of the <hi>Romanes. Trebonius</hi> was but little diſcouraged for all this, and diligently repaireth them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Domitius</hi> was forced to ſave himſelf by ſea, before <hi>Ceſar's</hi> arrivall, who (though the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> called upon him) would not leave <hi>Spain</hi> untill it was all at his devotion. There onely remained <hi>M.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7521:27"/>
But <hi>Ceſar</hi> having called an aſſembly at <hi>Cordova,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Corduba.</note> all came thither to attend and acknowledge him, and divers towns forced from them <hi>Varro's</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons: who found himſelf ſo farre forſaken, that of two Legions which he had, the one fell abſolutely from him, inſomuch that he was conſtrained to have recourſe to <hi>Ceſars</hi> mercy as well as the reſt. That done, he left <hi>L.

                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p>IT is a maxime held by all, and neglected by moſt, That in the time of truce there ought to be a better guard then at any other time. We have here a notable example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Trebonius</hi> by a marvellous labour had brought the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeillians</hi> to the laſt gaſp, when during the time of a truce (which out of pitie he had granted them) his ſouldiers ſo neglected their guards that they invited the enemie to their ruine, and he ſaw in one houre burnt what had coſt him the labour of many moneths. Which ſhould teach us in warre never to ſlacken the ſeveritie of military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, though the ſouldiers grumble never ſo much: for you ought rather to content them by any other means then that; and when they ſhall ſee their commanders ſhare the dangers and labours of the warre with them, they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo them chearfully. For we may reade that by the exact obſervation of military diſcipline many commanders have ſurmounted great difficulties and obteined glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that many others for diſregarding it have been ſhamefully defeated; but it hath never been read that the obſervation thereof hath been the cauſe of the loſſe of one battel or of the overthrow of any one enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>A great courage without experience is likelier to commit a great errour in warre then a more temperate one: for the firſt is uſually accompanied with preſumption, and is more incapable of counſel then the other; eſpecially when he hath made his entrie into armies by ſome happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. <hi>Curio</hi> is a fair example thereof, who of a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune</hi> of the people ſeeing himſelf a Generall of an armie,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7521:28"/>
committed many errours, and thoſe not ſmall ones: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had the good hap to beat his enemies, to ſhut them up into <hi>Utica,</hi> and upon the news of king <hi>Juba</hi> his coming to reſolve for the beſt, which was to retreat into his camp on the ſea-ſide, well fortified and well provided of munitions, there to attend the reſt of his armie; upon the firſt news that was brought him that the relief was weak, and that <hi>Juba</hi> was not there in perſon, without ſtaying for confirmation thereof, refuſing to adviſe with, or give credit to any, he croſſeth his first reſolution, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give them battel; after which his cavalrie meeting with ſome of <hi>Juba's</hi> horſe, of which foure were brought priſoners to him, he asked who commanded them; they anſwering that it was <hi>Saburra,</hi> he preſuppoſeth that <hi>Juba</hi> was not there; ſo confirmeth himſelf in the firſt errour, and marcheth ſo fast and ſo farre as that he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf five and twentie miles from his camp, in a countrey which he knew not, with part of his forces (the reſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to follow) much hurried and in diſorder: which was the cauſe that <hi>Juba</hi> eaſily defeated them. Which ſheweth us plainly, that neither a great courage alone maketh a good commander (however it helpeth well thereto) nor the reading of books, nor abilitie of diſcourſe; but it muſt be atteined by long experience, and the being preſent at many overthrows as well as victories: for he that hath not had his ſhare therein, is not able to imagine what belongeth thereto, the bravest ſouldiers ſometimes doing the pooreſt actions, as it happened here; where (though the reſidue of this armie was retreated into a well-forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied camp, and not aſſaulted, yet theſe imbarked themſelves ſo confuſedly and diſorderly as that a great part of them were drowned. Therefore I conclude that it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make leſſe haſte and to know whither to go then to be forced ſhamefully to run away or periſh.</p>

Therefore ſearching into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which cauſed in him this blind clemency, who ſeemed cruel to his own, I conceive we ought to diſtinguiſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. In <hi>Gallia</hi> he was a conquerour, in ſuch ſort as when they abuſed his firſt and naturall clemency, he uſed ſeverity; to keep thoſe in aw through fear which by affability could not be made pliant.

It is not ſo in a civil warre, which we make not but for the defenſe of our perſon or religion: for then having no deſigne to poſſeſſe your ſelf of the State, you are obliged to repell cruelty by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, otherwiſe you ſhould find none to take part with you. But when you fight for rule and domination, you muſt (to attein it) appear ſuch a one as that they may not ſuſpect either revenge or cruelty in you, and that they believe you to abound in liberality and all other ſorts of vertues: for no man at any time deſireth change of condition, but to better his own. So by this liberall reſolution and clemency, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his Dictatourſhip above eleven dayes, doin nothing but by the uſuall order, alwayes juſtifying his actions as a Protectour of the Common-wealth, ſhewing himſelf ſo much

the more affectionated to peace by how much <hi>Pompey</hi> held off from it, that ſo he might the eaſilier work the indignation of his citizens and ſouldiers againſt him, and by that means go the better through with the warres, he atteined the end of the higheſt and moſt glorious deſigne that ever was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ceſar</hi> having drawn all his forces together, attempteth to fight with <hi>Pompey:</hi> and not being able to draw him to it, he undertaketh a high deſigne, namely, to beſiege him in his camp, though he were the weaker of the two. This was near <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo,</hi> where he goeth about to encloſe him with trenches, helping himſelf with the advantage of little hills of difficult acceſſe, which in my opinion induced him to this deſigne. The reaſons which he alleadgeth are, that being weak in cavalry, and wanting corn, he could not get it if <hi>Pompey's</hi> horſe were at liberty; from which he ſhould alſo take away the benefit of forraging, and render it unprofitable to all the offices of war. Beſides, it was a way to diminiſh the reputation of <hi>Pompey</hi> throughout the whole Empire, and encreaſe his own, when it ſhould be reported that <hi>Ceſar</hi> kept him beſieged, and that he durſt not fight with him: a matter of great conſequence, for that men uſually turn to that ſide which is ſtrongeſt. On the other ſide, <hi>Pompey,</hi> being unwilling to quit the ſea-ſide or <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo</hi> where he had made his Arcenall &amp; Magazine, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not to budge: and ſeeing that his cavalry might ſuffer too much if it were hindred from forrage, he maketh an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of trenches of fifteen miles compaſſe on his ſide. So both Generall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> omit nothing that maketh for their deſignes. In the end <hi>Pompey</hi> finding himſelf diſcommodated by being thus cooped up, ſetteth upon one of the angles of <hi>Ceſars</hi> tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; where he had ſuch advantage in two encounters which fell both in a day, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> confeſſed, if he had known how to have proſecuted his victory he had defeated him. By this may be ſeen how neceſſary retrenchments are, &amp; how by means thereof may be prevented to fight with an army one is fearfull of: one may alſo reaſſure affrighted forces, and famiſh a more potent army then ones own. For the art of warre conſiſteth principally in not fighting but when men are willing; and to this end you muſt take good order for your victuall, you muſt well exerciſe your ſouldiers in the uſe of their arms, and in the obſervation of all orders, and know very well how to make their retrenchments. And if <hi>Ceſar</hi> had had to do with any but <hi>Pompey,</hi> who ſhut himſelf up from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7521:31"/>
he had either ruined his army, or elſe compelled him to fight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſeeing that he could not continue <hi>Pompey</hi> longer in that ſtrait, nor ſtay ſo near him without a great diſcommodity for want of victuall, he undertaketh to make a long retreat and for many dayes. To this end he cauſeth all the baggage to be ſent away over-night with one legion, about midnight all the reſt of his army ſaving two legions, and his cavalry (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with himſelf marched) at break of day. <hi>Pompey</hi> followeth him with all diligence, finding him quartered where he had been encamped before, and lodgeth himſelf alſo within his own old camp cloſe by him. But upon <hi>Ceſars</hi> making ſhew of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cavalry to forrage (cauſing them to return ſecretly into the camp again) <hi>Pompey</hi> ſendeth out his horſe to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in good earneſt; and then alſo the greateſt part of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being returned to their old camp to look for baggage which they had left behind them, <hi>Ceſar</hi> departeth ſuddenly in the ſame order as the day before. Inſomuch that <hi>Pompey,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to purſue him for the preſent, &amp; he continually march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by great journeys in the ſame order, leaving him no poſſible means to overtake him, at the end of foure dayes gave over his purſuit. This is a fair leſſon to teach us how dangerous it is for armies to retreat in view of an enemy; beſides, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully we ought to avoid fighting when we retreat, and what order ought to be given that we be not peſtered with the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; and that alſo a retreat is better made with a part of the army then with the whole. For if <hi>Ceſar</hi> were afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in the view of <hi>Pompey,</hi> with an army ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell exerciſed and accuſtomed to overcome, being redoubted by <hi>Pompey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; what ſhould then the captains of theſe times do, which command armies newly levied, without order, without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, overlaid with baggage, the ſouldiers not knowing how to uſe their arms, nor the captains themſelves to teach them? Yet nevertheleſſe they would think it a blemiſh to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to make a private retreat. Certainly preſumption and ignorance are two bad counſellers in warre.</p>
                     <p>At the battel of <hi>Pharſalia Pompey</hi> was twice as ſtrong as <hi>Ceſar,</hi> eſpecially in cavalry, whereupon he principally ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his victory; but he had not an army ſo well diſciplined nor ſo exerciſed to fight as <hi>Ceſar</hi> had: inſomuch that fearing that if his gave the charge they would do it diſorderly, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to attend the giving on of the enemy, with charge not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7521:31"/>
commanded his ſouldiers to give on upon the adverſe army, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that this exciteth the courage of ſouldiers to play the men, which ought rather to be increaſed then abated, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approving the ancient cuſtome of beginning the fight with a generall ſhout. And experience teacheth us that in all actions of warre, he which giveth the charge redoubleth his courage, and he which is charged diminiſheth his.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Pompey's</hi> order of battel; Having a river on his right hand, he placed all his horſe on the left, promiſing to himſelf that after he had repulſed <hi>Ceſars</hi> cavalry, he ſhould encloſe his army. <hi>Ceſar,</hi> judging his cavalry not of ſufficient ſtrength to reſist that of <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>gtheneth it by foot, which were fitted for that purpoſe, and mingled amongſt them. Beſides that, he taketh from every battalion one troup, whereof he compoſed a battalion to be as a reſerve, which he placeth without the ranks of the three orders of infantery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them not to ſtirre to the conflict untill he appointed: ſo that when <hi>Pompey's</hi> horſe had repulſed <hi>Ceſars</hi> (which they could not do without putting themſelves into diſorder) they met with this battalion, which put them to a ſudden ſtop, and afterward to ſhew their backs, and wholly to abandon the left wing of <hi>Pompey's</hi> army; by which means <hi>Ceſar</hi> following his advantage eaſily putteth all the reſt to rout. Whereupon we ought to obſerve two things: the one, That we ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to hazard all our troups upon one onely charge, but make a reſerve of the one to relieve the other: and the other, That we ought ſo well to obſerve the diſtances or intervalls, as well to the flanks as the rear, that the firſt troups happening to be reverſed, they reverſe not thoſe which ſhould relieve them; but to leave them a convenient ſpace to fall back, and to rally themſelves again in the rear.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Ceſar</hi> knew how to conquer, he knew better how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and make his benefit thereof, but in none like to this of <hi>Pharſalia;</hi> where he contented not himſelf to force the camp, to beſiege the reſt of the army on a hill whither they retired, nor to purſue <hi>Pompey's</hi> perſon certain dayes journeys, but with three or foure thouſand men onely followed him ſo cloſe both by ſea and land, that he found him dead in Egypt, where he arrived almoſt aſſoon as the other; never giving him leiſure to recollect himſelf, or reinforce his troups. Which ſerveth to teach us to make uſe of occaſion when it offereth it ſelf fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto us, &amp; not to deferre that to another time which may be preſently executed: for the affairs of the world are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

to great revolutions. And the affairs which <hi>Ceſar</hi> yet had after the death of <hi>Pompey</hi> give us occaſion enough to judge, that if (in imitation of many great perſonages) he had gathered the fruits of his victories before they had been ripe, or tasted of repoſe before he had been ſecured, he might full well have repented thereof.</p>

For having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the death of <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to ſet down there with three or foure thouſand men, and in this weak estate to attempt to force a young king to make reſtitution of part of his kingdome in favour of his ſister <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> was an argument that he truſted much to his good fortune, or was very amourous. But as this beginning was much ſhort of his ordinary prudence, ſo the progreſſe and the end thereof ſurpaſſeth all his other actions; and it ſeemeth that he hath not here erred but to make his vertues ſhine ſo much the brighter. This hath been a warre without rule: for he hath been put to defend croſſe wayes of ſtreets, and to barricado himſelf there, to diſpute the one half of the town againſt the other, to remedy unthought of accidents, to reaſſure his ſouldiers, to fight with a navall army with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſouldiers, and to beat them; and, as if he were fallen into another world, to make a warre after a new manner. Which ſheweth that he excelled in three things principally; namely, that he was never left hopeleſſe, that he was of great experience, and that he confounded not himſelf in his commands.</p>
                     <p>This warre finiſhed, he goeth against <hi>Pharnaces;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we will onely obſerve two things: the firſt, that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he deſired to finiſh this war ſpeedily, becauſe his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe required him elſewhere, yet he goeth not to aſſault him raſhly, but alwayes beginneth by encamping himſelf ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then (having left his baggage in ſafetie) he goeth with all his armie to make another camp near to <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> leaving a great valley between both; to the end that if he would hinder him from fortifying there, and aſſault him, he could not get to him without great diſadvantage. The other is to ſhew the advantage which he hath that aſſaileth: for <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelf obſerveth, that though <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi> aſſaulted him raſhly, yet his ſouldiers were ſtruck with fear, and put into ſome diſorder upon their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch. Which may ſerve to confirm that he which aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hath a great advantage, and that there is nothing more neceſſary in warre then retrenchments.</p>

The fame of his arrivall opened the gates of many cities and caſtles, which furniſhed him with victuall. He made choice of the ſite of <hi>Ruſpina</hi> to encamp himſelf, and there to expect the reſt of his armie; but not having patience to attend, he goeth to the port, imbarketh himſelf, and goeth to find them out; and as he was about to hoiſe ſail a good part of them arrive.

                        <hi>CEſar</hi> hath done three things in this warre which came near to raſhneſſe: the firſt, to paſſe into <hi>Africa</hi> in the dead of winter with a ſmall force, not having any aſſured port there, for which cauſe he was not able to appoint any <hi>Rendes-vous</hi> for his ſhipping; which thing was imputed him as a want of foreſight. Nevertheleſſe after his paſſage his manner of proceeding was altogether admirable: He maketh choice to encamp himſelf near the citie <hi>Ruſpina,</hi> which was within half a league of the port, which he joyneth to the citie and his camp, and fortifieth it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: for from thence he had one foot on land and the other on the Sea, and could (as occaſions ſhould require)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7521:36"/>
act by either ſea or land, and be ſecured from being ſhut up, whatſoever ſhould befall. This is a good leſſon for ſuch as enterpriſe upon a forrein countrey, being weak at the beginning: for in this poſture great attempts may be withstood, and in all extremitie a good retreat may be made. The ſecond, to leave his army near <hi>Ruſpina,</hi> and without giving knowledge to any man to caſt himſelf abord to go ſeek his ſhipping. And the third, having news of the defeat of his fleet, to leave his camp, to hasten in full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to <hi>Leptis,</hi> to caſt himſelf into a ſhip, and to rally others, and aſſault the enemies: and although he periſhed in none of them, there can be nothing ſaid in his defenſe, but that he truſted wholly to his good fortune, and that he never was wearied or diſheartned in the moſt dangerous or laborious deſignes.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable that <hi>Ceſar</hi> in all his warres hath alwayes been inferiour to his enemies in number; for which cauſe he hath alwayes helped himſelf by fortifications, more then ever any other hath done, which he made much the better when he found himſelf not ſufficiently ſtrong to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as he was a long time in <hi>Africa;</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> himſelf wondered at his coldneſſe: nevertheleſſe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued his ſouldiers in exerciſe, and himſelf exerciſed new-levied men, and entred them by ſmall ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, wherein by his induſtry for the most part he had the beſt; and alwayes attempted ſomething upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Which is an excellent maxime to give courage to your ſouldiers, and ſecure you from being ſurpriſed.</p>

                     <p>Concerning the cavalrie, they alwayes placed them on the wings: and whether it were the cavalrie or the infantery, they changed the form of their order according to the ſite of the places, or to the number of the enemies forces with whom they had to do, or to the order wherein they were ranged into battalia, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the front by leſſening the depth, &amp; doubling their front by the half files, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> did in the battel which he fought agaiſt <hi>Creſus;</hi> for fearing to be overwinged, he made his files (which were 24 deep) but 12, and ſo augmented the front of his army by the one half.</p>
                     <p>Beſides they made uſe of ſeverall orders of battalia according to occaſions; as the Orb, and the light-armed in the middle, to ſuſtein a ſtrong charge on all parts; or the Wedge, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enter into a battalion; or a Half-moon to encloſe or overwing; and others, which are of no great uſe in theſe times.</p>
                     <p>And that they might not confound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch orders when occaſions ſerved, they had publick Schools, where all the younger ſort of men went to exerciſe themſelves, which they called <hi>Gymnaſia,</hi> and had Maſters to teach the uſe of arms and motions, called <hi>Tactici.</hi> Now to perform all the motions they allowed to every ſouldier ſix foot of ground ſquare; and for fight, three foot; and to ſuſtein a violent charge
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7521:40"/>
they ſerried them ſo as they took up but a foot and a half.</p>
                     <p>By this means it was that ſo many ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths of the <hi>Grecians</hi> maintained their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties ſo long, &amp; have performed ſo brave acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, having repulſed ſo great armies with ſo ſmall forces, and having even planted their tropheys in <hi>Aſia</hi> and elſewhere; untill their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions overthrew them: which <hi>Philip</hi> dextrouſly laying hold on brought them to ſubjection; and after that, <hi>Alexander</hi> his ſonne with them and their <hi>Militia</hi> conquered a great part of the world.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed that the conſtitution of thoſe Commonwealths was more proper for a happy mainteining of their liberty then to encreaſe themſelves: for howſoever they all addicted themſelves to arms, ſo that none were exempted from them, yet their poverty, and the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſouldiers of every Commonwealth apart by it ſelf, hindred them from making any great progreſſe; ſo did their diviſions; it being a hard matter that ſo many ſovereigne Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths ſhould agree together, unleſſe it were in a common neceſſity, to defend themſelves, as they did divers times againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> but not for a conqueſt, where men cannot agree, neither about places of command, nor about ſharing of what is gotten.</p>
                     <p>Concerning their retrenched camp, which they called <hi>Aplectos,</hi> they choſe rather ſtrong ſites, then that they fortified them by induſtry neither had they any certain form, as the <hi>Romans</hi> had, but according to the advantage of places they fortified one part more then another: and hereof there is nothing certain to be found in writing amongſt ancient Authours.</p>

                     <p>The citie being more populous by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> the <hi>Legions</hi> were doubled, which then became to be of ſix thouſand foot and ſix hundred horſe; yet after that they have been of a greater number.</p>

                        <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> third king of the <hi>Romanes</hi> eſtabliſhed military exerciſe, and diſtinguiſhed all the people into five <hi>Claſſes</hi> or orders. They of the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> (as being the richeſt) were bound to mount and arm themſelves to ſerve on horſeback. The three following <hi>Claſſes</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on foot, and (according to their means) were <hi>Haſtati Principes,</hi> or <hi>Triarii,</hi> and were bound to arm themſelves according as their order required. The fifth and laſt <hi>Claſſis,</hi> as being too poor, was exempt from going to the war. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, after that the <hi>Romanes</hi> made war by ſea, which was foure hundred eighty nine yeares
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7521:41"/>
after the foundation of the citie, they choſe out the ableſt of this fifth <hi>Claſſis</hi> to make them ſerve at ſea; and yet they obliged them (in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie) to ſerve twentie years amongſt the land-forces.</p>
                     <p>None could attein to the office of a civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in <hi>Rome</hi> unleſſe he had ſerved ten years in the warre; nor by that could be capable of any ſuch office, unleſſe he were twentie ſeven years of age: for at ſeventeen yeares of age they were inrolled, and then entred into the warre, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their ſervice at forty five years of age. They were obliged during theſe twentie eight years to ſerve fifteen: and when they had accompliſhed their ſervice, they were no more tied to take arms, but onely for the guard and defenſe of the citie.</p>
                     <p>After that the kings were driven out of <hi>Rome,</hi> they choſe every year two <hi>Conſuls</hi> in their ſtead: Then thoſe <hi>Conſuls</hi> choſe twenty foure military <hi>Tribunes,</hi> but afterwards the people would chooſe them: fourteen of them were to have ſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready five years in the warres, and the other ten a longer time; namely in the infantery, eleven years; and in the cavalrie, fifteen years: which ſheweth what eſteem they had of their foot above their horſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Conſuls</hi> every year called out of all the <hi>Tribes</hi> ſuch as were from ſeventeen yeares of age to fourtie five to the <hi>Capitole</hi> or to <hi>Campus Martius:</hi> and ſuch as dd not there make their appearance were rigourouſly puniſhed; which was eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, for by the ordinances of <hi>Tullus Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> they kept a regiſter of all that were born, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7521:41"/>
that died: now they of the territorie were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned into the number of inhabitants as well as they which dwelt within the citie.</p>
                     <p>They alwayes choſe foure Legions, two for each <hi>Conſul;</hi> ſometimes they levied more, but very ſeldome, and that according to the neceſſitie of their affairs: And even in the time of <hi>Hannibal</hi> they had twentie three Legions, and yet every <hi>Conſul</hi> had but two, the reſt being commanded by <hi>Praetors, Proconſuls,</hi> and other officers. But after that the Common-wealth grew more powerfull, and their laws grew weaker, there have been under <hi>Ceſar</hi> in the warres of <hi>Gallia</hi> ten Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
                     <p>Before they proceeded to election of their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they divided the twentie foure <hi>Tribunes</hi> amongſt the 4. Legions: namely, of the fourteen youngeſt of them they gave foure to the firſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, three to the ſecond, foure to the third, and three to the fourth: and of the ten eldeſt they gave two to the firſt, three to the ſecond, two to the third, and three to the fourth. By this means there were ſix militarie <hi>Tribunes</hi> for every Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in every one both old and young ones.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> being thus diſparted and divided into foure parts, the <hi>Tribes</hi> were drawn by lot; and of the firſt they choſe foure men of a like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as near as could be: of theſe foure the ſix <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the firſt Legion choſe one; the ſix of the ſecond choſe the ſecond; the ſix of the third, the third; and the ſix of the fourth had the fourth man Then they choſe foure more, whereof the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the ſecond Legion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to chooſe the firſt; they of the third, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;

                     <p>After the election thus made of the Infanterie, the <hi>Cenſor</hi> elected the Cavalrie.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the number of ſouldiers of every Legion, it hath differed at divers times. For the Infanterie, it hath been 3000, 3200, 4000, 4200, 5000, 5200, 6000, 6200, alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that proportion of number, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience which they found in it for the readie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding them and forming of their <hi>Maniples, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,</hi> and <hi>Cohortes.</hi>

                     <p>The election being thus made, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of every Legion made them take the oath one by one, (holding up their right hand, and raiſing up the thumb of that hand) to obey and perform whatſoever ſhould be commanded them by thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a ſet day given them to meet at a place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed without arms, where the <hi>Tribunes</hi> choſe the youngeſt and the pooreſt to be <hi>Velites;</hi> the next, to be <hi>Haſtati;</hi> the more vigorous, to be <hi>Principes;</hi> and the elder ſort, to be <hi>Triarii.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then they were armed, and therein they ſometime varied: but moſt uſually the arms of the <hi>Velites</hi> were a morion, a ſmall target, darts, and a ſword. Their archers and ſlingers were called extraordinary, and were auxiliars. The <hi>Hastati</hi> bare targets of foure foot high, an head-piece, and a ſmall breaſt of the cuirace: The richer ſort of them bare the whole cuirace, a ſword on the right thigh, (being ſhort, broad, and ſharp-pointed, and cutting on both ſides) and two darts to caſt. The <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> bare the like arms; onely the <hi>Triarii</hi> in ſtead of darts had javelins.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Cavalrie; that was but ill armed at the beginning; but it learned of the <hi>Grecians</hi> afterwards to be armed with a cuirace, a buckler, and a caſting-javelin.</p>
                     <p>The Allies (aſwell horſe as foot) were armed and diſciplined as the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

And in effect there was no other body of the Infanterie amongſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> but of thoſe three orders, the <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii:</hi> for even the <hi>Velites</hi> had no body apart by themſelves, being both in the orders of battalias, as alſo in the encampings,

                     <p>The election being made, the ſouldiers armed, and the orders formed, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> ſeparated every order by <hi>Centuries</hi> or <hi>Cohorts,</hi> then made two elections of ten men apiece: they of the firſt were the more honourable, aſſiſted at the counſel of warre, and were as the Captains of our time; they of the ſecond repreſented our Lieutenants. Indeed all of them were called <hi>Centurions,</hi> but they of the firſt election were called firſt <hi>Centurions,</hi> and the other, ſecond <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions.</hi> After that, the <hi>Centurions</hi> choſe their <hi>Vexillarii,</hi> which are the Enſignes of our times, and there were two of them in every <hi>Cohort.</hi> Then they choſe twentie <hi>Tergiductores,</hi> which were Rear-commanders of the troups: ſo that in every <hi>Cohort</hi> there were two commanders for the front, and two for the rear.</p>

                     <p>A Legion was alwayes divided into five bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: namely the Infantery into foure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, called <hi>Velites, Hastati, Principes, Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii;</hi> and the Cavalrie into one. Every body was divided into ten troups, which amongſt the Infantery were called <hi>Cohorts</hi> or <hi>Maniples,</hi> and amongſt the Cavalrie were called <hi>Turmes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the three firſt orders of Infanterie were 1200 ſouldiers apiece, each of which make ten

troups of 120 ſouldiers: and in the laſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Triarii,</hi> there were onely 600 men, which make ten troups of 60 men apeece.</p>
                     <p>The body of Cavalrie was of 300, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ten troups of thirtie ſouldiers apiece.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt authours there is a diverſitie in the names of <hi>Cohorts, Centuries,</hi> and <hi>Maniples,</hi> which here do ſignifie one and the ſame thing; but in ſome places of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> you may ſee the diſtinction from a <hi>Legion</hi> to a <hi>Cohort,</hi> from a <hi>Cohort</hi> to a <hi>Centurie,</hi> from a <hi>Centurie</hi> to a <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Which I conceive grew from this, that when the <hi>Legions</hi> grew to be of 6000 and 7000 men, they then made thoſe ſubdiviſions.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of marching.</head>
                     <p>WHen they were to march, at the firſt ſound of the trumpet they took down their pavilions, and packed up the baggage; at the ſecond they loded it; and at the third they parted away from their quarter: But none were allowed to take down their pavilion, untill the <hi>Conſuls</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> had taken down theirs. The extraordinaries marched firſt; then the right wing of the Allies, and their baggage in their rear; then the ſecond <hi>Legion,</hi> and their baggage after them; then the left wing of the Allies, and their baggage following them: the cavalrie was in the van and rear, and ſometimes in the flanks, thereafter as the enemy was to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
                     <p>Every <hi>Romane Legion</hi> with one wing of the Allies marched in the van by turns, that ſo
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7521:44"/>
every one might have the commoditie of arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt at the camp.</p>
                     <p>If in the march there were greater ſuſpicion on the rear then on the van, or on the flanks, they ſtrengthened themſelves there accordingly. This was their ordinary manner of marching; but I find in <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that when he marched in an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies territories, and particularly in a countrey incloſed with hedges and woods, he made all the Legions to march in one body, then all the baggage together, leaving onely ſome new-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied troups on the rear thereof to guard it. When the army marched in three equidiſtant bodies, namely all the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> aſwell <hi>Romanes</hi> as <hi>Allies,</hi> together, having their baggage before them, then the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> in the ſame order, the extraordinaries and cavalrie were to be on the flanks and on the van to ſecure the baggage, or at leaſt on thoſe parts where the moſt danger was: And being ſo ordered, when an occaſion of fight befell, on what part ſoever it were, on a ſudden all the troups could be drawn out very eaſily (without being troubled by the baggage) to go and affront the enemy.</p>
                     <p>When the army drew near to the quarter, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Centurions</hi> ordained for that work marched before to conſider of the ſite of the camp: Which being made choice of, they firſt marked out the place for the <hi>Conſuls</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or of the Generall, with a white banner; then they diſtinguiſhed his lodging from others by a red banner; then with a ſecond red banner they marked out the <hi>Tribunes</hi> quarters; then with a third they divided and diſtinguiſhed the lodgings of the Legions from the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7521:44"/>
ones: after that they gave to every one their proportion of ground, which they marked with banners of other colours: then with a line they quickly marked out and divided all the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, becauſe they never changed the meaſures nor form of the camp; and that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well accuſtomed thereunto, by having alwayes the ſame way of encamping.</p>
                     <p>When the army arrived, every troup took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their lodging by the marks and banners; ſo that all went to them without confuſion, and without miſtaking.</p>

                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:7521:45"/>The <hi>Romanes</hi> allowed ten foot ſquare of ground to lodge two ſouldiers; inſomuch that allowing 100 foot breadth of ground, and 1000 in depth, there was ſufficient to lodge 2000 ſouldiers: and ſo ten cohorts of <hi>Haſtati,</hi> which made but 1680 ſouldiers, were lodged ſufficiently, and had room enough beſides for their baggage.</p>
                     <p>The ſame proportion of ground was allowed to the <hi>Principes,</hi> becauſe they conſiſted of the ſame number.</p>
                     <p>And the moity of that ground was given to the <hi>Triarii,</hi> becauſe their number was but the half of that.</p>
                     <p>To the cavalrie they allowed for thirty horſes 100 foot ſquare; and for 100 Turms 100 foot in breadth and 100 foot in depth apiece.</p>
                     <p>For the allies they allowed the ſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ground to their infantery as they did to the <hi>Romane</hi> legions; but becauſe the Conſul took the fifth part of the legions of the allies near to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they cut off alſo the fifth part of ground in this place, which they allowed them elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the cavalrie of the allies, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes double to that of the <hi>Romanes:</hi> but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul taking a third part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lodge round about him, there remained in the ordinary lodgings but one fourth part more of them then of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi> and becauſe the ſpace of ground was more then ſufficient for them, their ground was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, but they had 100 foot in breadth and 100 foot in depth, as the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This quarter was divided by five ſtreets, each of them of fifty foot in breadth; and divided in the middle by a ſtreet called <hi>Quintana,</hi> of the ſame length as the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:7521:45"/>At the front of the quarter there was a great ſtreet of 100 foot broad, next which the twelve Tribunes were lodged, juſt over againſt the two <hi>Romane</hi> legions; and the twelve Prefects were quartered juſt over againſt the two legions of allies: there was 50 foot ſquare allowed to each of theſe lodgings. Then there was the Conſuls lodging, called the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> which conteined 200 foot ſquare, and was placed in the middle of the breadth of the camp. On the right and left hand of the Conſuls lodging, there were two void places, the one for the market-place, the other for the Queſtor. On each ſide of theſe they lodged the 400 horſe and 1630 foot which the Conſul drew out of the two legions of the allies, as alſo the voluntaries: and beſides that ſome lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings were reſerved for the extraordinaries which might happen to come to the army, as wel cavalry as infantery; and theſe together made a perfect ſquare.</p>
                     <p>After all the lodgings were appointed, there was a ſpace left round about them of 200 foot broad: then they made a retrenchment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the moat was more or leſſe in depth &amp; breadth, and the rampart higher or lower, thereafter as the enemy was more or leſſe to be feared.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved that the infantery was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes quartered the neareſt to the trenches, as they which were to defend them, and which were to ſhelter the horſe, which were lodged in the middle of the quarters.

And when both the <hi>Conſuls</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were joyned and made but one camp, they took up the room of two ſquares. Sometimes both camps were near each other, but ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Polybius</hi> hath omitted the number of the gates of the camps, and their names, and where they were placed, how the encloſure of the camp was made, the lodgings for the <hi>Conſuls</hi> two <hi>Lieutenants</hi> (one for each Legion) of the <hi>Queſtor</hi> (who was their <hi>Treaſurer</hi>) of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of the camp (who was the fiſcall or marſhall judge) of the twelve <hi>Prefects</hi> of the Allies, of the victuall, the arms, and the engines for war, of the apparel, and what the tents were made of; which (with the help of ſome authours, and according to probabilitie) we will here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                     <p>Firſt we find in ſeverall hiſtories that the camp had foure gates, placed and called as is ſhewed in the foregoing figure.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the encloſure of the camp, we reade alſo that they made the rampart of the earth which they took out of the moat; and to make the earth hold together they planted two or three rows of ſtakes, about which they enterlaced bruſh-wood, after the manner of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</p>
                     <p>For the lodgings of the <hi>Conſuls</hi> Lieutenants, it is probable that they were lodged about the <hi>Praetorium.</hi>

                     <p>BEſides the oath which was required of the ſouldiers after their election, they were made to take another in the camp, namely not to ſteal any thing, and if they found any thing to carry it to the <hi>Tribunes. Polybius</hi> reporteth that it was thus done between the hands of the <hi>Tribunes;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith that they did it at the beginning of the election of ſouldiers between the hands of the <hi>Conſul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That done, they divided the <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati</hi> as followeth: two to take care to keep clean the great ſtreet which was between the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and the reſt of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and to caſt water on it in ſummer, to avoid the diſcommoditie of duſt; for that was a place where every day a great part of the armie met: The other eighteen were divided to ſerve the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> namely three for every <hi>Tribune;</hi> of which they took every day eight ſouldiers for the guard of their lodging. The <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Triarii</hi> made the guard for the <hi>Cavalrie;</hi> and one <hi>Cohort</hi> every day kept the guard before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls</hi> lodging.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7521:48"/>The moats and the ramparts were made on the one ſide by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and on the other ſide by the Allies. The <hi>Centurions</hi> made the ſouldiers to work at them, and two <hi>Tribunes</hi> had the charge to ſee the work well done.</p>
                     <p>The authoritie of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> in the camp was very great, and two of them together exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed it over their Legion for two moneths, after each other ſucceſſively.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Word; a ſouldier of the laſt <hi>Cohort</hi> of the Infantery, or of the laſt <hi>Turm</hi> of Cavalrie, was to come to the <hi>Tribunes</hi> lodging, and there to take it upon a writing-tablet, where alſo was written the name of the ſouldier which took it, and the place of his lodging; and this he delivered before witneſſes to the commander of his troup: That officer delivered it to the commander next him; and ſo the tablet was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from hand to hand to the firſt <hi>Cohort</hi> near to the <hi>Tribune,</hi> to whom it was brought back before night, ſo that by this means he was aſſured that all the armie had the word. And if any tablet were wanting of being brought back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it was eaſie to find where it had failed. It muſt be obſerved that here onely one <hi>Tribune</hi> is mentioned; which cauſeth me to believe that the two <hi>Tribunes</hi> which had the authority for two moneths time did agree to command every day by turns. Concerning the guard, it was kept day and night: and the foure and twentie houres were divided into eight watches.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the <hi>Conſul</hi> was guarded by his ordinary <hi>Cohort;</hi> then every body made their guard round about his lodging; and beſides there were three guards kept, one at the <hi>Queſtors</hi> lodging, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7521:48"/>
the two other at the lodgings of the <hi>Conſuls</hi> two <hi>Lieutenants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tergiductours</hi> or Rear-commanders order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guards, which drew by lot which ſhould begin firſt: and they which were to begin were led to the <hi>Tribune</hi> which then commanded, who gave them the order of the guard, and (beſides that) a little tablet with a mark; and all the guards were ſet after the ſame manner. The rounds were made by the Cavalrie, whereof the chief officer commanded foure for the day and foure for the night: the firſt went and took their orders from the <hi>Tribune,</hi> who gave them in writing what guards they were to viſit.</p>
                     <p>The relieving and viſiting of the guards was done eight times in foure and twentie houres, at the ſound of the trumpet, and the firſt <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Triarii</hi> had the charge to cauſe them to march when occaſion ſerved.</p>
                     <p>When the trumpet gave them warning, the foure forementioned ſouldiers drew lots, and he to whom it fell to begin, took ſome of his friends with him, and if in going the round he found the guards in good order, he onely took from them the mark which the <hi>Tribune</hi> had given them, and carried it him back again next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But if he found the guard abandoned, or any ſentinels aſleep, or any other diſorder, he made his report thereof to the <hi>Tribune</hi> with his witneſſes: and preſently a councel was called to prove the offenſe and to puniſh the delinquent according to his deſert.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Velites</hi> made the guard round about the retrenchment, on the outſide and inſide of it, and at the gates. The Allies had the ſame order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:7521:49"/>We find not in writing the number of their Corps-du-guards, how they placed their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels round about the camp, and how many a day were free from the Guard.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of puniſhments and rewards.</head>
                     <p>NOne but the <hi>Conſul</hi> could condemne any to death, and he had this authoritie as well over the principall commanders of the army as over the meaneſt ſouldiers thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> adminiſtred military juſtice, which was rigourouſly practiced. The manner of their ordinary puniſhing was thus,</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the <hi>Tribune</hi> had touched the partie condemned with a ſtaff or a rod, every ſouldier laid on upon him with cudgels, or battered him with ſtones, and oftentimes before he could get out of the camp he was killed: but yet if he eſcaped, he was not received into his countrey again, and none of his kindred durſt give him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinment.</p>
                     <p>He that oppoſed or neglected the orders gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the guard, or for the rounds, or other ſervice concerning the ſecuritie of the camp; or falſely pretended to have done ſome ſignall act; or had forſaken the place where he had been placed; or had loſt his arms in the battel; or had ſtolen any thing in the camp; or born falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; or elſe had forſaken his enſigne, was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed after this manner; as alſo he which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſmaller faults thrice.</p>
                     <p>If it happened that many Legions or one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or a groſſe troup had run away, they were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7521:49"/>
puniſhed two wayes: the more rigourous way was to make them all draw lots, and to puniſh every tenth man; or more or fewer according to the exigence of the cauſe: by this means all were partakers of the fear, and a ſmall number of them were puniſhed. The more gentle way was, to cauſe them to lodge without the camp, and to give them barley in ſtead of wheat, which was a mark of ignominie; which many troups have wiped out by performing valourous and memorable acts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning their rewards, they excited thoſe ſouldiers by honourable acknowledgements and publick commendations in preſence of all the reſt, which had performed ſome valourous and extraordinary act. Beſides that, to him that had wounded an enemy in ſome light skirmiſh, or that voluntarily had gone and aſſaulted him, they gave a dart: To him which had killed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed him (if he were one that ſerved on foot) they gave a target: if he were a horſeman, a horſe-furniture.</p>
                     <p>To him that (at the aſſault of a town) was firſt got up upon the wall, they gave a crown, which they called <hi>Muralis:</hi> to him which had reſcued a <hi>Romane</hi> citizen, a crown called <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vica,</hi> which was ſet upon his head by him which was ſo reſcued, whom he reſpected and honoured all his life after as his father.</p>
                     <p>The commanders had alſo their ſhares of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by the ſeverall triumphs which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, according to the greatneſſe of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the felicitie of their victories.</p>

                     <p>COncerning their pay; It began not untill three hundred fourty eight years after the foundation of <hi>Rome:</hi> before that every ſouldier armed and victualled himſelf at his own charge, which was no hard thing in thoſe times, becauſe their warre was then extended no further then <hi>Rome:</hi> But when they began to go out of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was neceſſary to give them pay, which at the beginning was very ſmall: afterwards it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed as the <hi>Romane</hi> empire grew in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I will not trouble my ſelf to make the valuation of it according to our money, it being a thing of no utility: onely I will ſay, that the ſouldiers pay muſt be ſo proportioned as he may maintein himſelf well thereby. I will further obſerve here, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> charged themſelves with the furniſhing of bread, apparel, arms, and tents for all their ſouldiers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, barley for the horſemens horſes (abating theſe things out of their pay) which I find to be a good order, and above all things neceſſary to make an army ſubſiſt: for beſides that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of ſouldiers are bad husbands, and ſuch (as if a care be not taken) will never be well clothed nor well fed, it is impoſſible that a ſouldier ſhould everywhere find bread to be bought, and that he ſhould carry all things with him which he ſtandeth in need of.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of their order of battalia.</head>
                     <p>THere is a diverſitie of opinions about the order of battel of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Some would have it that when the <hi>Haſtati</hi> be not able to ſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the enemies charge, in their retreat they ſhould fall into the order of the <hi>Principes</hi> by files; and both they into the order of the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and ſo to renew the fight three times. Others will have it to be done by troups, whereof I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is much the greater probability, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt way not onely impoſſible to be put in practice but alſo moſt dangerous, &amp; the other exceeding feiſible and profitable. For to fall one into another in that maner by files, the <hi>Haſtati</hi> muſt then fight at ſo wide a diſtance, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two files they might receive two other files, which ſheweth the weakneſſe of this firſt order, which being ſo ranged in battalia could not be able to repulſe nor ſuſtein the adverſe battallion. And even the files, being at ſo wide a diſtance from each other, were not able to keep themſelves right in fight nor to obſerve their diſtances; but in the other way there are many conveniences to be found. Firſt many bodies of a hundred and twenty men apiece (or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts) aſſaulting a battallion, they may very well defeat it; at the worſt they may retreat without diſordering themſelves or looſing their diſtances. And the ſecond order, which is embattelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the firſt, juſt over againſt their intervalls, may eaſily fill them: as alſo (in caſe of neceſſity) the third body may ſupply thoſe diſtances which are reſerved for them, renewing the fight three
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7521:51"/>
times. And that which confirmeth us the more in this opinion is, that in reaſon it ought to be ſo: next, the deſcription of the battel of <hi>Zama</hi> which <hi>Scipio</hi> fought againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> where it is ſaid that <hi>Scipio</hi> to hinder <hi>Hannibals</hi> elephants from routing his ſouldiers, cauſed the <hi>Cohorts</hi> of the <hi>Principes</hi> (which were placed juſt over againſt the intervalls of the <hi>Haſtati</hi>) to ſtand juſt behind them, ſo to leave ſtreets for the paſſage of the elephants: which ſheweth plainly that the order of battalia was diſpoſed by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,</hi> and not by files.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not of the <hi>Velites</hi> in this order of battalia, nor of all other light-armed ſouldiers, becauſe they fought not but with caſting-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and afar off, and when the armies approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the ſhock, they retired themſelves behind the heavie-armed.</p>
                     <p>Now to form the ſaid order, I will ſay that the file was alwayes of ten men in depth; that a Cohort or Maniple of a Legion of foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred men conſiſted alwayes of one hundred and twentie ſouldiers, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cohort made ten ranks and twelve files, conteining (at ſix foot ſquare of ground for every ſouldier) ſeventy two foot in breadth and ſixty in depth: and the moity of it when they were at three foot diſtance.</p>

                     <p>NO <hi>Romane</hi> Commander hath made braver ſieges then <hi>Ceſar,</hi> nor deſcribed them more perfectly.

At <hi>Cadenac,</hi> which was a ſite inexpugnable, he conſtrained the garriſon to yield it, by taking away their water. At <hi>Alexia,</hi> where were 80000 ſouldiers within the town, and which expected two or three times as many, he ſo forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf before it, both againſt the town and againſt the enemy without, as he famiſhed it. And at <hi>Bourges</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles</hi> he took the firſt by aſſault, and conſtrained the other to yield, when it was upon the point of being taken by aſſault. I will not here particularize the engines
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7521:53"/>
which they then made uſe of to force places of ſtrength, becauſe the cannon hath taken away the uſe of them. Yet I will onely ſay that they approched to the walls by degrees, as much ſheltred as they could, and then attempted to batter them down by their engines, or by mines to force an aſſault, or at leaſt to lodge upon the breach: which I the rather ſpeak, to ſhew that howſoever we have changed the manner of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, the better to make reſiſtance againſt our new thundring engines, nevertheleſſe the ancient maximes for the taking of towns are the ſame, which we make uſe of at this day. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſiege of <hi>Alexia,</hi> it is the modell by which the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola</hi> have directed themſelves to make theirs. And all theſe great works and circumvallations which we admire, and by the help of which they have taken many great cities in ſight of greater armies then their own, which have not been able to relieve them, are nothing in compariſon of thoſe which <hi>Ceſar</hi> made at this ſiege of <hi>Alexia.</hi> To conclude, they which come neareſt to the manner of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> as well in ſieges as in the field, are they which prove the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commanders.</p>

                     <p>NOw that we have ſhewed the ancient <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> by means whereof they have obteined ſo many brave victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7521:53"/>
we muſt yet obſerve two principall cauſes, which their moſt excellent Commanders have ſucceſſefully obſerved to obtein victories in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: namely, to ſtrive to overwing their enemy, and never to cauſe their army to fight all at once. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to keep himſelf from being overwinged in the battel which he fought againſt <hi>Creſus,</hi> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the front of his army by as many more as they were, by making the files of his infantery but 12 deep, which before were 24: and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe his enemy, he placed his beſt men on the wings; who having defeated the wings of the adverſe army, came to aſſault the body of the battel on their flanks and on their rear. At the battel of <hi>Cannae Hannibal</hi> placed all his beſt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on the wings, and the meaner ones in the middle, that ſo the <hi>Romanes</hi> finding but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance there, might inſenſibly ſink into them, and by that means they found themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed on both flanks. At the battel of <hi>Pharſale, Ceſar</hi> ſheltred one of the flanks of his army by a little river, and fortified his Cavalry (which was on his other flank) by a body of Infantery, to reſiſt <hi>Pompey's</hi> horſe, which exceeded his own by much; ſo that having routed it by this means, he aſſailed the army on the flank, and eaſily defeated it. At the battel of <hi>Zama Hannibal</hi> made a body of all his old companies of <hi>Italy,</hi> which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from all his army, that ſo when all the reſt (as well of the one part as the other) ſhould be weary with fighting, this body being freſh, might carry away the victory. So that <hi>Scipio,</hi> after that he had defeated all that were before him, found himſelf aſtoniſhed to ſee a ſecond army for him to fight with afreſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:7521:54"/>Here may be an objection made, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might be ſo unequall in number, as all theſe maximes might prove unprofitable; whereunto I anſwer, that when an army paſſeth a certain number of fourty or fifty thouſand men, the ſurpluſſage ſerveth for no other end but to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the army: for it is an eaſie thing by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching to avoid battel. And if you ſhould reſolve to give battel, if you would obſerve the forementioned orders, there is no plain ſo ſmooth but you may find ſomething wherewith to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one of the flanks of your army; either by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wood, hill, or a ditch; and the other with waggons: nor nothing that ſhall be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from having ſome body of reſerve which ſhall not fight at the beginning; nor from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thoſe troups on the wings which you eſteem to be your beſt ſouldiers. Which things if they be exactly obſerved as they ought, they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail very much for the obteining of victory.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> A comparing of the arms and military orders of the Romanes with thoſe of the Grecians.</head>
                     <p>THe arms of the <hi>Grecians</hi> were the buckler, the pike, and the ſword. Their order was of great bodies of battalions of 16 deep of the heavie-armed, and then ſtrengthened by eight in depth of the light-armed: ſo that the battalions came to be 24 in depth, and fought all at once, making all one front.</p>
                     <p>The arms of the <hi>Romanes</hi> were the target and the ſword; their order was to make ſmall bodies
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7521:54"/>
of 150 or 200 ſouldiers at the moſt, which were onely ten in depth, and to make three orders of battalia, that ſo they might fight three times, one after another.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the arms of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> it ſeemeth that their long pikes had a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Romane</hi> targets, becauſe they reached farre; and even at this day we find no weapon comparable to the pike againſt the violence of the horſe: and for their order, thoſe great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies met with nothing that could reſiſt them. On the other ſide thoſe great <hi>Romane</hi> targets co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſouldiers ſo well as the pikes could not hurt them; and if once they came to joyn, they made a great ſlaughter with their ſhort &amp; broad ſwords; for then the pike was unuſefull. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, their ſmall troups gave them this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that they brought more hands to fight at once. Concerning their diſpoſing of their three orders one behind another, to the end they might relieve each other, and to be able to begin the fight again by all three, they had this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, that all were not wearied nor diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at once. In ſo much that oftentimes they have carried away the victory after the defeat of their two firſt orders: for that their third order being freſh, and having rallied all the reſt, gave the laſt charge againſt an army which was tired and in diſorder, and ſo gained the battel.</p>
                     <p>There be two diſcommodities more in thoſe great bodies; namely, that they muſt ever have a very ſmooth field for the battel, elſe they are not able to keep their order; and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agitate on the right or left, but onely fight juſt before them. But the ſmall troups weild
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7521:55"/>
themſelves on all ſides, and continue their order in all places. It is true that the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times joyned all their forces together, making but one body of all their army, in an Orb; but this was but to ſave themſelves in a retreat, and not to charge an enemy: for as theſe great bodies are as it were unmoveable and of little uſe in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults; ſo when they will onely defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are hard to be broken.</p>
                     <p>And yet they uſed not this laſt order bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> when they were perſecuted by the arrows of a great Cavalrie, as that of the <hi>Parthians:</hi> for not being able to come to hand-blows with them, they were conſtrained to put themſelves into this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to ſhelter themſelves with their targets. So that I conclude that the arms and orders of the <hi>Romanes</hi> were better then thoſe of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> becauſe ſmall troups accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better to all ſites then great ones, and fighting at ſeverall times they continue the fight with more obſtinacie then when all fight at once; and that it is more eaſie of many ſmall troups to make a groſſe readily and without diſorder, then of a groſſe to make many ſmall troups.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He election of ſouldiers was by the Ancients and is by Moderns made after divers wayes. The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> contented not themſelves to enroll the ſouldiers which of their own accord were willing to go to the warre, but choſe out of them ſuch as they judged to be fitteſt for that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which is the cauſe they had ſo good ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for the moſt part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſtrangers, and therefore had no worſe ſouldiers then their own countrey-men. The <hi>Turks</hi> chooſe their ſouldiers, and train them. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> make uſe of their own men. The <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> are ſerved by auxiliarie ſouldiers. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germanes</hi> abound in good ſouldiers, and may well forbear auxiliaries. <hi>England</hi> alone,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7521:57"/>
of all the States of our time, may chooſe them, and take ſuch as ſhe pleaſeth. Whereupon we muſt conſider the conſtitution of theſe States, on what maximes they be founded, and what either of them may beſt do to have good ſouldiers. The greater part of States at this time are more found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon policie then upon warre, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour rather to conſerve themſelves then to grow greater. Wherefore we ſee that learning flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there, and arms degenerate; in ſo much that thoſe States which are founded upon warre do devour the other.</p>
                     <p>The example of the <hi>Turk</hi> to the ſhame of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that of the king of <hi>Spain</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are two manifeſt proofs. That which cauſeth this miſchief is, that men of the gown have poſſeſſed themſelves of the government of almoſt all States, which (for that they hate ſouldiers) cauſe them alwayes to be ill dealt with, and do adviſe Princes to imploy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliars rather then their naturall ſubjects: which is a moſt pernicious maxime. But this being no fit place to treat of it, we will onely ſpeak of the election of ſouldiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England,</hi> which hath right by the laws of that kingdome to make choice of her ſouldiers, may obſerve the form of the election of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which is very good. The other kingdomes which have not that power muſt incite their men which are ambitious of honour to cauſe themſelves to be enrolled, aſwell for the hope of being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to other honours by embracing the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of warre, as by ſhutting up the means of atteining thereunto by any other way then that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:7521:57"/>
For example, not to beſtow any office of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor of the kings houſe, nor any charge amongſt the ſouldiers, to any but ſuch, as have ſerved in the warres a certain number of years; nor to make any man Colonel of horſe which hath not been a Captain and other officer of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie; nor any to be Marſhall of the field, which hath not honourably born leſſer charges; nor any to be Generall of the army, which hath not been a worthy Marſhall of the field: briefly, that none may be advanced to any office, which hath not paſſed through the degrees of warre. And as the hope of advancement is a ſtrong ſpur to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage every man to exerciſe the profeſſion of arms; ſo the fear of finding ones ſelf poore and needy after long ſervice is a ſharp bit to keep men from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>. Therefore I would prevent that by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a foundation for men of that profeſſion, ſo that they might live out the reſt of their dayes commodiouſly and honourably. Thoſe States which by reaſon of their form of government are fearfull to arm their own people (as <hi>Venice</hi>) or where their ſubſiſtence dependeth on traffick (as the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi>) and which for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are conſtrained to help themſelves in their warres by auxiliars, muſt principally be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to chooſe good Commanders; next, to have a certain body of well exerciſed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

in their great numbers. And great conqueſts are almoſt alwayes made by ſmall armies, as great Empires are alwayes loſt with their innumerable forces. For that they which were to fight againſt ſuch numerous armies, oppoſed them with an exact diſcipline and good order; and the other, having neglected all diſcipline and order, have endeavoured to ſupply that defect by their great number of men; which hath brought upon them the greater confuſion and hath ſerved them for no other end but to make their loſſe the more diſgracefull. VVhence I conclude, that the beſt means to have good ſouldiers is to chooſe ſuch as are moſt fit for warre; the ſecond, to incite men of ambition and vertue freely to enroll themſelves, by ſhutting the doore of any other way to advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and laſtly, to entertein a body of an armie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be carefull (as well in peace as in warre) to keep them under an exact diſcipline, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation One of which three wayes all ſorts of States may make uſe of.</p>

Cavalrie, for that many of them joyned together make a very ſolid body, and very hard to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on their front, by reaſon of their length, whereof foure or five ranks extend the heads of their pikes beyond the firſt rank of men, and do alwayes keep out the ſquadrons of horſe from them twelve or fifteen foot of. <hi>Maurice Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> had a great deſire to make uſe of the target, and having cauſed divers trials to be made thereof, hath found that it hath not onely reſiſted the pike, but that half the number of targets hath alwayes entred into twice the number of pikes, and hath routed them. Nevertheleſſe, being but Generall of the armies of a State, and not a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne and abſolute Prince, he durſt not make ſo great a change; whether it were that he feared the Cavalrie, which now-adayes is exceeding well armed or elſe the reproch of ſome evil ſucceſſe; not being ignorant that the people Judge of the actions of ſuch as ſerve them rather by the event then by reaſon. For my part, I would adde this kind of arms to our diſcipline, making alwayes the principall body of my Infantery to be of pikes, and to have for every battallion a ſmall body ſeparate of one hundred or one hundred and twentie tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to charge on the flank, which would work a marvellous effect on the day of battel; and this ſhould be the true place of voluntiers, and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brave Nobilitie, which often prove to be but troubleſome to an army. Concerning the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive arms of the Cavalrie, there be of five ſorts; namely, the lance, the piſtoll, the ſword, the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and the musket: the two firſt are given to the heavie-armed calvarie, which muſt have for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7521:59"/>
defenſive arms the cuiracecask, vambraces, taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, cuiſſes, and guard-rein, and (not many years ſince) ſome horſes have been armed with barbs. Of the two other kinds, they which ſerve with carabines have the head-piece and cuirace; and becauſe they fight on horſeback, they muſt be well mounted: but they which ſerve with the musket have no defenſive arms. Of theſe five ſorts of offenſive arms there be but three much in uſe; namely, the piſtol, ſword, and carabine. The Spaniards onely have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſome few companies of lances, which they keep rather for gravitie then reaſon; for the lance doth no effect but by the violence of the carreir of the horſe, and beſides there is but one rank which can make uſe of it; ſo that their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be to fight by ſingle ranks, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt the ſquadrons: and if they ſhould fight in ſquadrons, they would rather be troubleſome then ſerviceable. And for musketiers on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back or dragones, they are alſo in a manner left off, for that in the civil warres they ruined the Infantery, every man deſiring to have a nag, that ſo he might be the fitter to rob and pillage: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe ſome well-ordered troups of this kind in an armie are of very great ſervice; either for executions, to gain bad paſſages, to guard the quarters of horſe, or elſe (on a day of battel) to cauſe them to diſmount as forlorn hopes before the ſquadrons of Cavalrie.</p>
                     <p>Now the Cavalrie muſt be proportioned with the Infantery; which may be diſtinguiſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſituation of the countrey where the warre is made, or elſe according to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt whom you are to fight. For if you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7521:59"/>
you be in a champain full of forrage, and if ye be to make warre againſt a great Cavalrie, as that of the <hi>Turk,</hi> in ſuch a caſe you muſt fortifie your ſelf with the greater number of horſe. But if the warre be in a countrey encloſed, either by mountains, forreſts, moores, or hedges and ditches, and that hath many fortified places, for that the warre is rather reduced to ſieges then to battels and field-combats, in ſuch a caſe you muſt ſtrengthen your Infanterie. And theſe two bodies are ſo neceſſary the one for the other, as an armie cannot be held to be good nor ſubſiſt unleſſe it be equally provided of both. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if I were not induced by ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reaſon, I would make the proportion of my army for the open countrey of a fourth part of horſe to three fourth parts of Infantery; as to twentie foure thouſand foot, eight thouſand horſe: in an incloſed countrey, of a ſixth part of horſe to five parts of foot; as to twentie foure thouſand foot, foure thouſand horſe. It remaineth to give to theſe two bodies ſuch arms as were before mentioned with the moſt profitable proportion. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> have many more pikes then muskets, and for this they have made themſelves to be much feared in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain countrey; for in a day of battel where you come to hand, the number of pikes hath much advantage of that of muskets. Other nations do equally divide the pikes and muskets; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the war in theſe times is reduced to ſieges rather then battels, we deſire to have a greater number of muskets then of pikes. For my ſelf, which adde the targets to them, my opinion ſhould be to have the regiments of 1440 ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7521:60"/>
namely of 600 pikes, 600 muskets, and 240 targets. For the Cavalrie; I would proportion it after this manner: I would compoſe the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of 500 horſe, whereof I would arm 400 with Cuiraſſiers arms; 50 with carabines, and 50 to be dragones.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, to provide good arms for your ſouldiers, unleſſe you oblige them to wear them; it being an unſufferable ſhame to ſee their delicateneſſe in theſe times, and how they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem them: and to cover this fault, they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that it is want of courage to go armed, and that they will go in their doublets into the moſt dangerous places, aſwell as they which are arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is not enough to go into a place to cauſe ones ſelf there to be knocked on the head; we ſhould go thither to conquer, and not to be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Beſides this inconvenience groweth of it, that if you uſe not your ſelf to wear your arms, you are ſo peſtered with them as you cannot fight in them: on the contrary, if you accuſtome your ſelf to them, they are no more troubleſome to you, and you are at as much libertie in them as if you were in your doublet. But the greateſt miſchief that cometh of it is, that the ruine of military diſcipline followeth on it; which a good Captain ought to cauſe to be exactly obſerved in every part. For if he ſlacken it in one, or in favour of ſome perſons, the conſequences which follow on it by little and little will be ſuch as they will wholly overthrow it: and then he ſhall find himſelf without obedience and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; which he ſhall never recover without incurring the hatred of thoſe whom he hath too much ſpared; it being moſt certain that it is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7521:60"/>
eaſier to prevent a miſchief then to help it when it is befallen.</p>

                     <p>BEſides that which hath been ſaid to incite every one to take upon him the profeſſion of arms rather then any other, we muſt make other obſervations to make a man worthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which conſiſt in three things: namely in the recompenſe of commendable actions, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of bad ones, and in the continuall and exact exerciſe of militarie diſcipline; for there is no profeſſion in the world which hath more need of ſuch helps then that of warre, where for the ſingle pay (which hardly affordeth livelyhood, and with which the meaneſt artiſan would not be contented) the ſouldier abandoneth himſelf to all ſorts of perils and labours: but none are inſtigated thereunto unleſſe it be by emulation of honour, or by licence to do evil; and as the firſt aim is vertuous, ſo you ſhall have good ſervice of ſuch as enter into it for that end. But of the other you ſhall reap nothing but ſhame; for in ſtead of a good and obedient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my you ſhall find that you have no better then a troup of pillaging rogues, which without order or obedience forſake you, either after a good boot-haling, or in any eminent danger. For this reaſon the election of ſouldiers is a better way of forming an army, then onely to receive voluntaries; where all the vagabonds and evil livers, and ſuch as cannot live but by robbing, cauſe themſelves to be enrolled. Therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7521:61"/>
ſuch as are vertuous to well-doing, and to deterre the vitious from doing evil, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and puniſhments are principally neceſſary. The <hi>Romanes</hi> have made very profitable uſe of theſe two means: and if we follow not their way we ſhall never have good nor well-diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouldiers. It matters not though we uſe not the very ſame remunerations and the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments they did; it ſufficeth that they be equivalent, that ſo we may receive the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them: and theſe things are diverſly done, according to time and cuſtome. The principall is to be an exact obſerver of them, that ſo the remunerations may excite brave men to worthy actions, and the rigour of puniſhment may keep cowards from doing baſely. The manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimating the ſouldiers which the <hi>Romanes</hi> had, is held to be cruel: nevertheleſſe there be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo infamous actions committed, as you are conſtrained to uſe great ſeverity, to give a terrour to all; finding it very good to ſtrike a fear into all thoſe that have eſcaped by the means of the lot, and to put but few to death. For you muſt imprint this belief into your ſouldiers, that by baſe flight they eſcape not death, but they onely exchange a glorious death which they ſhould have acquired by fighting valiantly for an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one. After that the ſouldier be incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the honour of being eſteemed valiant, and brought to a hatred of being held a coward, it muſt be made a like degree of honour for every one to know how well to obey his ſuperiour, from the private ſouldier to the Lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: for on this obedience all the functions of an army depend, and without it you can keep no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7521:61"/>
in rule, nor do any thing that is good. This muſt be ingraffed into the hearts of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as being one of the principalleſt vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in them. From hence groweth order; by this military exerciſe is mainteined; briefly, by this brave deſignes are executed, and without this all goeth to confuſion and ruine. I will not trouble my ſelf here to ſpeak of the particular military exerciſes which the ſouldier is to be exerciſed in, becauſe divers books are ful of them, and that cuſtome doth alwaies change ſomething or other in them. I will onely ſay that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo profitable as to exerciſe every ſouldier to carry his arms properly, to uſe them ſouldier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to keep his rank well, and therein well to execute all the motions and charges which are commanded him. So much concerning the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: But concerning the recompenſe of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of armies, I will ſay the ſame which I ſaid for the ſouldiers, namely, that according to the time, or the conſtitution of kingdomes or common-wealths, ſuch courſes ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as the honour of ſuch as have done brave actions and great ſervices be not diminiſhed nor blemiſhed: For that the moſt generous ſpirits (which will eaſily excuſe all want of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe for their ſervices) will never endure to be robbed of the honour due to their brave actions, and will ſooner ſtomach ſuch a want of due honour then any other thing whatſoever: whereupon very often great miſchiefs have followed.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the obedience of ſouldiers.</head>
                     <p>NOw as the Generall of the armie requireth of the ſouldiers that obedience which is due to him, ſo he muſt have a care to give them no juſt cauſe to exempt themſelves from it: to this end he ought to keep them in continuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for that idleneſſe engendreth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners and diſcipline, whence proceed luxury, neglecting of exerciſes and the guards, and diſobedience to ſuperiours. It was the eaſe and idleneſſe of <hi>Capua</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Hannibals</hi> army, and the delicacies of <hi>Babylon</hi> which corrupted <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, and from whence he drew away his army to prevent the totall ruine of it; there being no means of greater efficacy to keep it in due order, and to prevent ſeditions, then to imploy it in warre. It is therefore a maxime which muſt be exactly obſerved, never to ſuffer your ſouldiers in any place to be idle, eſpecially when the army is brought together in a body; for if you imploy them not in that which is good, they will buſie themſelves in that which is naught. This courſe muſt be taken aſwell in the time of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt peace as of open warre; particularly, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them to uſe their arms well, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve good order; and though there be no need, yet to uſe them to make retrenchments of the camp, and to make their huts: that ſo they may be ſo accuſtomed to remove the earth, that when neceſſity ſhall require, it may be no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them. I would further imploy them to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7521:62"/>
make fortifications and other works of this kind, not onely to keep them in exerciſe, but that alſo they may get (beſides their pay) wherewith the better to maintein themſelves, and that they accuſtome themſelves to that which in time of warre is as profitable to them as to fight well, there being nothing impoſſible for twenty or thirty thouſand men which will work in the earth; for in eight dayes they will make fortreſſes which ſhall be impregnable: And <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath made himſelf as much redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admired by the great works which he hath cauſed his ſouldiers to make, as by his great battels. Moreover, the Generall muſt take care that they be well clothed and well fed; eſpecially that (out of their payes) they be furniſhed with clothes and ſhoes, otherwiſe he will ſoon find his army to decay, and diſeaſes to rage in it for want thereof. He muſt alſo have a great care of thoſe which are ſick and hurt, and therein to ſpare for no coſt; that ſo the ſouldiers may not excuſe themſelves from going on upon dangerous ſervices, or to undergo laborious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, becauſe they are abandoned when they are ſick or wounded. The General ought alſo to take a particular care not to overlabour his ſouldiers, nor to put them to extraordinary hard marches without great neceſſity: but when need requireth it, he muſt be the firſt to undergo the labour; for the example of the commander maketh all things eaſie to the ſouldier. The examples not onely of the greateſt Captains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancients, but even of the greateſt Monarchs and Emperours, ſhould ſhame our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Captains of theſe times, which are afraid
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7521:63"/>
to ſpoil their fair complexion in the ſunne, and their goodly plumes in the rain, which would believe themſelves to be diſhonoured if they ſhould march on foot at the head of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and thoſe great men have not ſcorned to march at the head of their armies, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to quench their extraordinary thirſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was not water enough to make all the army to drink; and ſo making themſelves companions of the dangers and labours of their meaneſt ſouldiers, have made themſelves maſters of the greateſt part of the world, and have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an immortall glory.</p>

                     <p>THere are divers conſiderations to be made upon the marching of an army; which may be aſſaulted in the day-time, or at its diſlodging, or even in the night when it is lodged. If it be not encamped, but lodge in villages, you muſt (to cauſe it to meet in one body) give it a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vous on the way which it muſt take; which if the enemy learn time enough to be there firſt, or that he meet with it there by chance, he will put the army to run a great hazard, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to its Rendez-vous at divers times and by divers wayes. The beſt means to guard ones ſelf from ſuch an accident are, to keep your Rendez-vous very ſecret, to have good ſpies amongſt the enemies, and to ſend out many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers for intelligence. When you encamp you are not ſubject to that danger, becauſe the army is alwayes together. For the march you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7521:63"/>
muſt conſider the countrey where you are, and the number of ſouldiers which you have. If you march in great plains, you may (for the moſt part) march in battalia; or at leaſt with form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed battaillons and ſquadrons: then it is very eaſie to put your ſelf readily into a good form to fight well, becauſe you march not in a long order. But when you march through a ſtrait countrey, where but few can march in front, then you muſt compute the diſcommodity of the way, and the time you have for your march, with the number of ſouldiers whereof your army conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for 10000 foot marching 10 in front, and 1000 horſe marching 5 in front, with the lighteſt baggage they can poſſibly have, and ten cannons, with equipage for every piece to ſhoot 100 bullets, take up about 28000 foot of way in length; whereby you may judge how much way in file 30000 foot and 6000 horſe will take. Therefore when ſo great armies find themſelves in ſuch a troubleſome way, you muſt of neceſſity divide them into ſeverall bodies, which may march one after another, and lodge ſeverally; or rather cauſe them to march by divers wayes, ſome miles diſtant from each other; or howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to make wayes through the fields for your ſouldiers to march in, leaving the great road for your cannon and baggage. If there be a river to paſſe where you can make but one bridge, or ſome paſſage over a mountain, mooriſh ground, or forreſt where you cannot make ſeverall wayes, then you muſt march one after another, and on ſeverall dayes. I trouble not my ſelf to ſhew how you are to paſſe through ſuch bad paſſages in view of the enemy, becauſe many
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7521:64"/>
have written thereof: yet when it cometh to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, few will get off well, if they be charged home; but I will onely ſay that the beſt way is to calculate the time ſo well as you may avoid ſuch encounters. Concerning the march; I find it almoſt impoſſible that two armies ſhould meet each other, if one of the two Generals be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to avoid it, eſpecially in an incloſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: but whatſoever happen, the beſt way is to have the baggage wholly ſeparated from the ſouldiers, leaving onely on the rear ſome few troups to keep it from diſbanding: for if in time of alarm every body have their baggage behind them, it cauſeth a great confuſion, and hindreth the ſouldiers from rallying themſelves and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other. The time of lodging is alſo a dangerous time to be aſſaulted in, becauſe the army is then tired, and every man (deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be lodged) haſtneth to the quarter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which is a thing hard to avoid, if (before you enter your lodgings) you cauſe not your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſtand in battalia, and ſo cauſe them to lodge troup after troup, without ſuffering any to lodge but by command, mean time ſending out on all ſides upon diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth the aſſaulting of a quarter, which is that which is more frequently attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially when the army is not encamped; becauſe it being lodged in ſeverall quarters, the enemy may attempt to ſurpriſe ſome one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without hazarding a generall combat: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ofttimes you have not leiſure to put your ſelf in order to fight; therefore you muſt be carefull to ſend out diſcoverers every night, by divers ſmall troups, which (if they do well perform their task) will not ſuffer you to be ſurpriſed; for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or a groſſe troup capable to aſſail a quarter of an army cannot march ſo ſecretly that it be not perceived. And when you have to do with a vigilant enemy, and that you fear ſuch aſſaults in the night, there is nothing ſo good as to prevent him, if it be not in earneſt, at leaſt to give him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms every night, that ſo he may be more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about keeping himſelf upon his guards, then about aſſailing you. If it be in an intrenched camp, where all the army is in one body, it is a high enterpriſe to aſſault it. And this one chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſheweth the ſecurity of an intrenched camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I will end with this concluſion, That all the forementioned things to aſſure the quarters muſt never be omitted, though you believe your ſelf to be far off from any enemy; for that, beſides the profit you draw from hence in accuſtoming your army to do their duties, there may ſuch an occaſion befall you as it may be the ſafety of your army, of your life, and of your reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>I Will not here deſcribe the form of entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed camps, but onely the profitableneſſe of them, not being able to wonder enough that they have been wholly diſcontinued. No people made ſo exact uſe of them as the <hi>Romanes;</hi> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7521:65"/>
in our time <hi>Maurice Prince of Orange</hi> hath revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the uſe of them, or at leaſt hath given them a great perfection. The entrenchment of a camp aſſureth an army, in that it is never diſperſed in the villages, where ſome quarter or other is ever in danger to be ſurpriſed, but lodgeth all in one body, and in ſuch faſhion as being aſſailed it may fight with great advantage. The entrenchment ſaveth a great deal of trouble, becauſe by it there is need of the fewer guards by many, &amp; thoſe leſſe toilſome, eſpecially to the Cavalry, which when they are lodged in open villages, are conſtrained to be on horſeback almoſt all night. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment encloſeth your army as a walled city; from whence you may march privately with ſuch troups as you pleaſe, to execute all ſorts of brave deſignes, leaving your baggage in ſafety. The entrenchment hindreth the enemy from conſtraining you to fight, unleſſe when you pleaſe. The entrenchment cauſeth you to be without danger at the head of the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full armies. The entrenchment cauſeth you to take ſtrong cities in the face of more puiſſant armies then your own. Briefly, the entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is leſſe ſubject to infection then the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges where you lodge, becauſe you chooſe a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome place to ſit down in, and in villages you muſt take them as they fall out: Alſo, becauſe this is more ayrie, the lodgings are here better divided, thoſe things which may cauſe bad air are more eaſily removed; and in effect an army incamped and entrenched wil rather ſubſiſt three moneths in health in a camp, then a forthnight in the beſt villages. Whence I conclude, that one of the moſt neceſſary parts of warre is,

                     <p>OF all the actions of warre the moſt glorious and moſt important is to give battel: the gaining of one or two acquireth or ſubverteth whole Empires. Anciently all warres were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by battels, which cauſed ſuch ſpeedy conqueſt: For the preſent, warres are managed more fox-like then lion-like; and are rather founded upon ſieges then combats. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, there be divers nations at this day which decide the moſt part of their warres by battels, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Perſians:</hi> and even amongſt the Chriſtians we have ſeen of late divers bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels given in <hi>Germanie,</hi> whereof onely one had almoſt inthralled all the Proteſtant Princes. And an army well-diſciplined, and which feareth not battel, hath a marvellous advantage in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of that which feareth it. For this reaſon (howſoever the manner of warring at this time be not ſo frequent in the hazarding of battels as in times paſt) the knowledge of them muſt not be neglected. And a Generall of an army can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be a good Captain, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all advantages which may be taken on a day of battel, and all diſadvantages which ought to be avoyded; that ſo he may well diſintangle himſelf. I will not ſpeak of duſt, the ſunne or rain, whereof it is obſerved that many Captains have made uſe, driving them on the face of the enemy by gaining the wind of them; becauſe they are caſuall things which may change in a

moment, and which by conſequence happen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by hazard then come by deſigne; but of things more ſolid.</p>
                     <p>He then that will give battel muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſeven principall things. The firſt is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſuffer himſelf to be forced to fight againſt his will. The ſecond, to chooſe a field for the battel fit for the quality and number of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: for if he feareth to be incloſed by a great number, he muſt ſhelter his flanks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at leaſt one of them, by the nature of the place; as by a river, wood, or ſome other thing equivalent: and if he be weak in his Cavalry, he muſt avoid the plains; as he muſt ſtrait paſſages or enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed places, if ſtronger. The third, ſo to range his army in battel, as according to the quality of his ſouldiers it may be within its own advantage, ſheltring his horſe by his foot, if therein he be the weaker; and if the contrary, his foot by his horſe; diſpoſing all his ſouldiers in ſuch order as they may fight divers times before they be wholly defeated: for if we well obſerve the ſmall troups of ſouldiers which fight not all at once, and believe that a hundred horſe in two troups wil beat two hundred in one entire troup, and have obſerved in our times that divers bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels have been won by him which had made a troup of reſerve, which was not to fight untill all the reſt had fought, how much greater effect will a ſecond order of battel produce, which will come to the charge after that all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe army hath fought againſt the firſt order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet after that a third, in imitation of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> if the two former be defeated It is a maxime, That every troup (how groſſe ſoever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be) which hath fought, is in ſuch a diſorder as the leaſt troup that chargeth it, is able to defeat it abſolutely: ſo that that Generall which can reſerve ſome troups to the laſt without fighting, will with thoſe bear away the victory: it being a long work and difficult to go about to rally an army that hath fought into good order to fight afreſh; ſome gazing about for pillage, others being vexed to return to the danger again, and all being ſo diſtracted as they do not or will not underſtand any command: on the contrary, ſuch as have not as yet fought, are under obedience, and ready to do whatſoever their Generall ſhall command them. So that the knowledge of a Generall of an army is not ſo much to rally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and defeated troups (which is properly but an action of courage) as to make his troups fight to good purpoſe, the one after the other, and not all at once: for he muſt conſider that he cannot be well obeyed by his ſouldiers, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untill the houre that he ſendeth them to the combat. After that all the orations of the world will not ſtay them when they flie; but this troup which is in good order will eaſily do it. The fourth is, to have many good command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it being impoſſible that a Generall ſhould ſuffice for all places. After that he hath made a good choice of his field for battel, and put his army into good order, it is altogether impoſſible for him (when it cometh to blows) to give order, more then in that part where he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: ſo that if he be not well aſsiſted every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe, aſwell amongſt the horſe as foot, though he ſhould work miracles in that place where he himſelf is, he cannot make good the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7521:67"/>
ignorance of thoſe officers which command in the other parts of his army. Therefore there muſt be at leaſt five principall commanders to make an army fight well, namely for three bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Infantery, diſtinguiſhed by vanguard, battel, and rearguard, and two for the horſe which are on the wings. The fifth is, ſo to obſerve your diſtances in your order of battel, that the foremoſt troups being put to recoil, may not fall upon thoſe which ſhould come up to relieve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the ſecond upon the third. The ſixth is, to place the moſt valiant ſouldiers on the wings of the army, and to begin the battel by that wing which you think to be ſtrongeſt; for if you once break one of the enemies wings, you fall upon his flank and rear, and it is impoſſible for him to reſiſt you. The ſeventh and laſt is, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any to purſue the enemy, nor fall to pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, untill he be routed on all parts; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be good to give him a hot chace, you muſt ever have ſome troups in order, which muſt not disband, that ſo you may avoid all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. I will not ſpeak of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which may be met with in a field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, whereof a good Captain often maketh uſe with great profit; becauſe there can no certain rule be given for it, by reaſon the diverſitie of ſituations is ſuch, that you ſhall never find two every-way alike.</p>

                     <p>BEcauſe the gain and loſſe of battels draweth ſuch conſequences after it, as it giveth or taketh away whole Empires at once, it hath cauſed a reſolution of oppoſing the conquers by fortified places, to ſtay their firſt fury with few men, and to ruine their armies: But ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the cannon they have been enforced to change their manner of fortifications; and even by reaſon of the invention of petards we have beene conſtrained to aſſure the gates of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by portculices, palliſadoes, draw-bridges, and other inventions; becauſe there was no place, how ſtrong ſoever it were, which did not runne a hazard to be ſurpriſed by this new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Now the beſt fortreſſes againſt the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non are thoſe which are made of earth; becauſe (when they have a ſufficient thickneſſe to make reſiſtance) they are not ſubject to endamage the beſieged, as thoſe fortifications are which are made of maſons work, the ſhivers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do much miſchief. Nevertheleſſe, when a Prince can be at the coſt to line them as high as the rampart, leaving the parapet upon it to be of earth cannon-proof, it maketh the work to laſt the longer.</p>
                     <p>In fortreſſes you muſt obſerve foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall things: namely, that the line of defenſe be within musket-ſhot; that the flanked angle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not ninety degrees, nor be leſſe then ſixty; that the gorge of the bul-wark be not too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and that the flank be as great as may be. And
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7521:68"/>
theſe foure generall maximes muſt be ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned amongſt themſelves, as that to make one of them exceeding good you deſtroy not the reſt. You muſt alſo avoid tenailles in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall body of fortification, unleſſe the ground be ſo ſmall as it will not ſuffer you to make good flanks. For the interior angle of ſuch a fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raiſed as it ought to be cannot be defended by any flank, and men may lodge themſelves at the foot of it without receiving any hurt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be by ſtones thrown over. This is the reaſon why tenailles are not uſed but in the counterſcarps. The moats are uſually propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned according to the earth neceſſary to make the fortifications; and ſuch as are full of water are beſt to hinder a ſurpriſe, and the forts defend themſelves the beſt againſt an aſſault: their breadth muſt have a due proportion; for when they are too broad the out-works are too farre diſtant from the defenſe of the principall fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but depth never ſpoiled a moat. The falſe brayes are joyned to the body of the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is anew invention and excellent to hinder the approching to the bulwarks by gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries. The counterſcarp, half-moons, ravelins, and horn-works are beyond the great moat; all the out-works (if it be poſſible) muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the body of the fortification. Theſe are in groſſe the principall obſervations which are in fortifications in a place which is levell and approchable: the reſt dependeth on the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Enginier, which muſt make profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe of the ſituation of the place which he is to fortifie, either in taking what ſerveth for his advantage, or in avoyding whatſoever is to his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7521:68"/>
hinderance. I adde further, that there be ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations ſo favourable, as nature it ſelf defendeth them, and maketh them more inexpugnable then all the art in the world; as an inacceſſible rock, a quagmire or a lake: But every commodity hath its diſcommodity; ſeldome you ſhall meet with ſuch ſituations on frontier-places, or upon any important paſſage, or capable to contein a garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſufficient ſtrength to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NOw that we have ſpoken of fortreſſes, we muſt come to the way of guarding them, and not ſuffer them to be ſurpriſed. It is moſt certain that men will alwayes attempt to take them by ſurpriſe rather then by open force; for that thereby they ſave charge and time. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſurpriſes are grounded upon ſome defects which they find in the place, or in the guard thereof, I will begin with that which muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to defend your ſelf againſt ſuch ſurpriſes.</p>
                     <p>The Captain which ſhall have a place to guard muſt provide for ſix principall things,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7521:69"/>
whereon all the reſt depend: namely, to ſee that the walls be out of danger of a ſcalado; the gates not ſubject to the petard; the way for the rounds eaſie and convenient; the ſentinels well ſet; the guard very exact; and to hinder intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and treacheries. For the five firſt, the way is beaten for them, there be books full of inſtructions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d there be now ſo many Princes orders in writing and in practice, as he muſt be very negligent which is not carefull therein. But for the laſt it is not ſo eaſie to give rules. Treachery may be wrought by the townſmen or ſouldiers: the mingling of them together, whether it be on the guards, rounds, or patroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, may much hinder it; as alſo the drawing all the functions of the guard by lot, the keeping a guard without the town, and the having of ſpies amongſt the enemies. You muſt double your guards at times of fairs and markets, in harveſt and time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>intage, becauſe men uſe to ſpy out ſuch times to frame a deſigne. You muſt obſerve to be in arms at the opening and ſhutting of the gates; and in whatſoever time of peace it may be, you muſt never neglect the obſervation of any of theſe particulars. There is alſo a way to avoid intelligences, namely, by making double enterpriſes your ſelf, feigning to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent an officer, private ſouldier, or townſman, who running over to the enemy, cauſeth him to undertake ſome deſigne probably feiſible and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: for beſides the profit which you gain by it, by getting the boldeſt of them in a trap, you reap this advantage by it, that your enemie dreameth on no other ſo long as he hopeth in that; for that every one alwayes undertaketh
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7521:69"/>
that which he believeth will ſucceed moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Whereby we may ſee how doubtfull thoſe enterpriſes are which are grounded upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, either for that they may be double, or elſe by the fault of traitours, which in the very point of execution may loſe courage and diſcover all; or by their indiſcretions and not keeping ſecret their negotiations. For theſe reaſons in enterpriſes made upon intelligence both the defendant and aſſailant muſt be very ſuſpicious and exceeding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to obſerve the words, actions and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of ſuch as promiſe to ſerve them by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own ſide, and to omit no precautions to aſſure themſelves of their perſons, ſo that they may not catch them; the hoſtages of women and children being not alwayes ſufficient (as <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> obſerveth at the enterpriſe of <hi>Darges</hi>) for that ſome traitours are ſo reſolute as they will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all to attein the height of their deſignes, and make account to releaſe their pledges by ſuch priſoners as they intend to take.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth a word to be ſpoken of alarms. You may therein uſe two wayes: the firſt and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way is to put your ſelf in order in the allarm-place, where the governour muſt be preſent, that ſo from thence he may lead to the place of danger; the ſecond is, for every company to repair to their colours, and from thence to go and find out their ſquadron which is upon the guard. If the garriſon be weak, the ſcalado eaſie, and the place large, this laſt way of going to the alarm is the beſt, becauſe they go more readily to the defenſe of the walls; but in this caſe they muſt have no ſuſpicion of the fidelitie of the inhabitants.</p>

                     <p>THe enterpriſes of fortified places are made after ſeverall faſhions, either by petard, or by ſcalado, or by ſome holes in the wals, or by ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidges, or by ſome ſuch other wayes and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which men ſeek every day to encreaſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the remedies againſt ſuch as are alreadie invented. But to make them take good effect you muſt be very carefull of three things; namely, intelligence, conducting, and execution: for for want of one of theſe we ſee all enterpriſes miſcarry; either by being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the day-light, or being diſcovered too ſoon, or for want of ſome petard or ladder, or by ſome diſorder in the execution. For the firſt, which is intelligence, they which are imployed in it muſt inform themſelves exactly of the form of the garriſon, number of the townſmen, and of their affections. They muſt obſerve at the gates whether there be a bridge dormant to come at them; whether it be of wood or ſtone; and if of wood, whether they uſe not to take away ſome planks in the night-time; whether this bridge hath not rails: whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They muſt well obſerve all the hindrances which may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7521:70"/>
the bridge dormant, whether they be gates, barres, palliſadoes, or portculices, there being uſually a ravelin: and whether there be a corps du-guard kept in the night, either on the outſide or upon the bridge dormant: taking notice how many gates, bridges, barres, palliſadoes, portcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, trap-doores, grates, iron-pinnes, chains, and other impediments whatſoever there be from the field to the inſide of the town, and how all theſe things are faſtened: how many paces of diſtance there may be from one piece to another, and (as near as may be) the length, breadth and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all thoſe things, and in what places they are: whether there be loopholes over the gate, or holes in the roof of it: how many corps du-guards there be, in what places they are, and how ſituated; whether the entrance be ſtraight on, or winding; obſerving the place of the flanks, whether they be on the ſide before, behind, above, or below; whether they keep any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance there, and how many; or whether they be onely for musketiers; what number may be lodged on them, and at what diſtance they flank the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7521:71"/>
the dvenues, the counterſcarp and the moat; to know whether you may come at it undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, go down into the moat, and come up out of it eaſily, eſpecially over againſt the place where you would make the ſcalado, or near it. For if you muſt go farre about the town after you be entred into the moat, the enterpriſe becometh much the more dangerous and difficult. It muſt be known whether the moat be drie or frozen, or that the water be but ſhallow, without mud and eaſie to paſſe; whether the wall be low or weak, ſo as it may eaſily be ſcaled or pierced, or whether there be ſome hole or drain or other means for the water to paſſe in or out which are ill guarded or weak. You muſt judge what height your lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt be of, and regard how they may be ſet on ſure footing, and whether there be a ſcarp or not; whether the place where you mean to give on be far from guards or ſentinels; whether the place of ſcalado be capable to raiſe good ſtore of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and for ſtore of men to enter at once: as if it were very ſtrait, you muſt ſee if the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred can accommodate themſelves upon the rampart to ſubſiſt ſo long untill the reſt mount. You muſt alſo obſerve the diſtances of the wall to enter into the town, and to go and ſet upon the corps du-guard.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond, which is the conducting, it may be made two wayes, by parts or in groſſe: by parts, when they are deſignes upon places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and which are farre within an enemies countrey, and whereof the enterpriſes are held to be very f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iſible in the execution; for they may not fail, without putting all the ſouldiers which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7521:71"/>
go on that ſervice into eminent danger: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be great prudence uſed, and none imployed in it but reſolute men and ſecret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt either there overcome or periſh; which happeneth not in ſuch enterpriſes where there is as great care taken of the ſafety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating as of giving on. The Marſhall of <hi>Briſac</hi> made one (being in <hi>Piedmont</hi>) upon the caſtle of <hi>Millain,</hi> which was excellently well conducted, and deſerveth to be here taken notice of, to ſerve for a leſſon for ſuch as may deſire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the like.

The firſt rendez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

The manner of meeting at this farm-houſe was thus; At the parting from the valley <hi>Camonica</hi> or <hi>Bergamaſque,</hi> the firſt five or brigado (and ſo by turns all the reſt) found a countrey-fellow having a ſtraw-hat with two pheaſants feathers on it; to whom the chief
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7521:72"/>
man of every brigado was to ſay, <hi>O buon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagno, voi tu vender my quella capelina!</hi> that is, <hi>Ho, good fellow, wilt thou ſell me that hat?</hi> to which he was to anſwer, <hi>Meſſer no, ne ho bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſogno per me;</hi> that is, <hi>No ſir, I must uſe it my ſelf.</hi> That was the watchword; which being ſo known, the chief (without ſpeaking a word) followed the countrey-fellow, which conducted him with his brigado to the farm-houſe where <hi>Lodowick Birague</hi> was; and in this wiſe the Marſhall of <hi>Briſac</hi> his hundred and twenty ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers paſſed very ſecretly to that place. From this farm-houſe they were to get to the houſe of one of <hi>Sienna</hi> near <hi>Millain,</hi> who was the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the deſigne: to this end they paſſed along as before, by five and five together, and after they had paſſed the river <hi>Adde</hi> at the haven of <hi>Vaure,</hi> they had meaſured the time to arrive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night at the bridge <hi>Navilio</hi> of <hi>Millain,</hi> near the Monaſtery of <hi>Angels;</hi> on which bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, the chief of the brigado ſhaked a little bell, at the ſound of which he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by another like it, and preſently there came (from below the bridge) the man of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> (the authour of this deſigne) who conducted the brigado to his own houſe, and continued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner every night, untill the whole troup was paſt: which is a matter worth the obſerving, to cauſe a hundred and twenty ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to go by ſtealth from <hi>Piedmont</hi> to the very gates of <hi>Millain,</hi> without being diſcovered, and not a man of them (except onely <hi>Salvaiſon</hi> and <hi>Peter Maria</hi> of <hi>Recuperat</hi>) untill then, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither they went or where they were. Concerning the conducting in groſſe, which is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7521:72"/>
the more ordinary, you muſt meaſure the length of the way to the place upon which you have your deſigne, with the time which you muſt have to arrive at the juſt time to execute it: wherein many deceive themſelves very often, for that uſually there befall unexpected caſualties which prolong the time; inſomuch that what meaſures ſoever you take (without great experience in ſuch actions) you ſhall commonly find the time too ſhort, eſpecially if you have a groſſe troup to lead. For to make two thouſand men to march by night in their long order, the Altes which muſt be made at the head to ſtay for the rear, or thoſe which a narrow or troubleſome way, or that is cut off by a river compell you to make, are ſuch, and cauſe you to loſe ſo much time, that unleſſe you be very diligent to make them march, and that you have cauſed good intelligence to be taken of the way, and provided for all theſe things, you will find you have not half time enough. I ſpeak not of the great ſhowers of rain, nor of froſts, which ſometimes happen ſo unlooked for and extraordinary, that, what fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight ſoever you may have uſed in all other things, it is impoſſible to overcome them. After that you have proportioned the time with the way, you muſt provide your ſelf of good guides, and as many of them as may be: then you muſt form your order before you depart, as it ſhould be at the execution, giving to every man your commands in writing of what he is to do, and keeping a regiſter thereof. For if you deferre to do it untill you come upon the place where you are to alight, and where all the equipage is to be accommodated (which is uſually about half
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7521:73"/>
a league from the place) may hinder you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the place haply will not be ſpacious enough nor commodious to make the order, contentions which may befall, jealouſie of honour amongſt the ſouldiers, and divers unthought-of accidents w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ariſe, are able to fruſtrate the deſigne: which things being reſolved on before your going out, and there being nothing to be changed in your order, this (moſt certainly) is the means to avoid ſuch obſtacles. I adde this, That if it be a citie from whence you go out, you muſt keep the gates ſhut long before and after; and cauſe the troups to march by day, that ſo you may ſee that not a man go out but they of the enterpriſe. And afterwards to cauſe the troups to make Alte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the gate or in ſome private place near hand. Concerning the order; you muſt cauſe ſome horſe to march foremoſt, whoſe ſcouts muſt have charge to ride farre enough before, and to ſeiſe upon all ſorts of perſons whereſoever they go, that ſo they may hinder the giving of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the town which you intend to ſurpriſe; eſpecially if there be ſome bridge or paſſage by which unavoydably you muſt paſſe, you muſt gain that. Then muſt fifty musketiers follow; next the train, the petards or ladders, being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by thoſe men which are choſen to carry them; whereof there muſt be a treble number, to eaſe and ſucceed each other, in caſe any be hurt or killed: and theſe muſt be men of execution, the moſt reſolute and adventurous of the troup; for on theſe foremoſt uſually the good or bad ſucceſſe dependeth: you muſt alſo carry double equipage of petards, becauſe all work not that effect which you purpoſe they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7521:73"/>
ſhould; and often the want of one petard hath cauſed brave enterpriſes to fail, and ſo of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are often broken by the enemies, or break by being too much laden. In the purſuit you muſt not make any troup of above fifty ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, namely fifty muskets, then fifty pikes, and ſo ſucceſſively: for you muſt conſider that the firſt encounters are in narrow ſtreets, and in the night; ſo that the groſſe troups cauſe but diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And if you find ſtreets that are broader then the order which you have framed, you muſt joyn two troups together, that ſo they may take up the whole breadth of the ſtreet. Every troup muſt have officers at the front and rear of it, and the ſergeants on the flanks, to keep them to their duties, and to hinder them from ſtraggling and pillaging. You muſt alſo obſerve in the order you make (when you part from your quarter) that if you make ſeverall aſſaults, the commanders, ſouldiers, and equipage muſt be diſtinguiſhed into ſo many troups as you will make aſſaults, and that they march according to the order they ſhould aſſail in. In all enterpriſes (eſpecially in thoſe where the retreat is dangerous and long) you muſt more regard to have good ſouldiers then many; for a ſmall troup may come from farther off, march more ſecretly, and retreat with leſſe danger and confuſion then a groſſe troup. Beſides, a ſmall troup with good ſtore of officers, is more obedient in execution, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth leſſe diſorder then a groſſe, I adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in enterpriſes by night you affright an enemy as much with a ſmall troup as with a great one: for it is a maxime, That they which are ſurpriſed and aſſailed fight in fear, alwayes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7521:74"/>
perſwading themſelves that you aſſail them with forces ſufficient. Briefly, if you overcome with a ſmall troup you get more honour then if it had been with a great, which ofttimes diſturbeth you both in fight, in march, and in their retreat: and if you be beaten, the diſhonour is the leſſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the third, which is the execution, all the order muſt be given in writing, that ſo none of them which have any command in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe may excuſe themſelves by pretending they miſunderſtood you. If it be by ſcalado, there muſt be 2 men to carry every piece of a ladder; and becauſe it is almoſt impoſſible to do the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution upon a place where there needeth more then five pieces of ladders in height, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that there be ten men for every ladder, and one man to command them: The men for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ladder muſt be mentioned in a roll by their names and ſurnames, and of what company they be. You muſt command them on pain of death to bring back their ladders if you cannot get the town: for they ſeeing the danger and trouble of bringing them back again, will rather deſire to do their uttermoſt endeavour to enter the town moreover you muſt command ten other men to enter after the firſt ten, which muſt be led by an officer, and another to be on their rear to take care to ſee them mount without loſing of time and without making too much haſt: otherwiſe the ladders will be ſo much laden as that they will break; after this, ten more muſt follow, commanded and divided as the former: and every file of ten muſt know by which ladder they muſt mount, and in what order, that ſo al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:7521:74"/>
which follow their ladder muſt carry another, though they have no order to raiſe it; that ſo if any piece of the firſt ſhould break, there may another be raiſed in the ſtead. If it be by petard, the petardier ſhall call him that is to carry the madrier or planchier; then he is to call three for the petard (two to carry it, and the third to aſſiſt in time of need) and if the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier be faſtned to the petard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foure men may carry it interchangeably by two and two: and thoſe two which carry not the petard with the planchier ſhall each of them have a great ſmiths hammer. After theſe foure, the petardier ſhall call two men, each of them carrying a great ax; after them one with a crow-lever, then another with a dark-lantern, then one with three or foure pieces of lighted matches: beſides theſe there muſt be one to command them, which ſhall carry a piercing inſtrument, or a coopers turrell, or ſome good hooks with ſteeled points, and a weighty hammer. So that to attend every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard well there muſt be ten men; this file of ten for the firſt petard ſhall be led by ſome brave Sergeant, which ſhall have the name of every man of his file in writing, and ſhall alſo know what every of them is to carry. The men muſt know the Mule which carrieth their equipage, and ſo ſoon as they come to the place where they are to unlade, they muſt place themſelves about the Mule, that ſo each of them may receive what he is to carry. If the ſecond petard muſt be applied to a gate or barres, they which ſhall carry it muſt be in the ſame order as they of the firſt petard: but if it be for a draw-bridge, the rolling-bridge or carriage goeth formoſt, with ſeven or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7521:75"/>
eight men which are imployed as well to carry it as to puſh it forward: after this the planchier and petard muſt be carried, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the firſt; then ſhall they follow (in file and in cloſe order) which carry the ladders and planks to caſt upon the breach which the petard ſhall have made upon the draw-bridge; then ſhall they follow which carry ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers, hatchets, pinſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, inſtruments to pull out bolts and to cut chains; then ſome with fire-lances and granadoes, and ſome dark lanterns. The officer which ſhall have the leading of them muſt take care that not a man loſe his rank, and ſhall divide them into files, and ſhall take care to cauſe the ſpare men to carry ſuch portions of the equipage as they did carry which ſhall happen to be hurt or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which he ſhall onely cauſe to be laid out of the way, without ſuffering thoſe which are to be imployed about the ſervice of the petard to trouble themſelves about carrying away any man that is killed or hurt. At all the gates and bridges the men muſt be diſpoſed in the ſame order. But when you go againſt iron-grates or portcullices, you muſt cauſe thoſe to march firſt which carry the treſſes or iron-hooks; then marcheth the planchier and the petard; after which follow hammers, hatchets, crows of iron, and other inſtruments which may be thought fitting: you muſt not forget to carry fire-balls, granadoes, or fire-lances, if you have obſerved that you may make uſe of them; every man muſt carry a hatchet at his girdle: you muſt rather have a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary number of inſtruments, then want one. Having thus put all into order, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at the head and on the flanks of every file,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7521:75"/>
you muſt have beſides ſome petards, planchiers, and other inſtruments for reſerve, which muſt be carried in the ſame order as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ther: For you muſt alwayes have a double equipage. When you come near the place where the execution is to be done, you muſt diſtribute to every man what he is to carry. The Sergeant ordereth them in file, and commandeth every one duly to follow his leader: then he cauſeth them to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to give room to thoſe of the ſecond petard; and ſo conſequently of all the reſt, there being a guide for the firſt file to ſhew them the way. And that you may not be intangled, ſometimes you may cauſe ten cuiraciers to march before one foot, to diſcover whether the enemy be not on the advenues; then follow three men bearing good targets, to ſhelter (amongſt others) the petardier; then march they which carry the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards and the other train, in ſuch order as hath been ſaid, which ſhall be followed by fifty muskets led by a Captain, to give fire for their defenſe (if need be) with large hailſhot. He muſt look that no man ſtay by the way as they march; when the enemy asketh, <hi>Who goeth there,</hi> they muſt haſten their pace, and then the petar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier taketh the firſt petard with him, and the reſt muſt follow very cloſe, that ſo when the firſt is fired the ſecond be ready to be put into his hands. The ten horſmen which have marched before all the equipage ſo farre, ſhall not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance further then the diſtance of piſtoll-ſhot from the firſt bars; then they ſhall fall back to the Captain which leadeth the fifty musketiers. The firſt petard being fired, the officer ſhall cauſe his men to be placed on the right and left hand,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7521:76"/>
to give room for the ſecond petard; then that ſhall do the ſame, to give paſſage to the third; then that maketh room for the rolling-bridge, and they for the petards and other inſtruments, and conſequently all the reſt. And they which are unladen muſt help the reſt, without making any noiſe. And if the petardier calleth for any thing, he that carrieth it muſt be ready to give it him, and no man upon pain of death muſt ſtirre out of the place where he was placed, but onely to give to the petardier what he calleth for, or to ſupply ſome bodies place which in carrying ſomething to the petardier was hurt or killed. The officers muſt take care that the petardier be preſently ſerved, and all be done without noiſe or confuſion. The ouverture being made, they which ſhall be commanded for the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts muſt be ready to enter, and to force whatſoever ſhall reſiſt them; they which are to follow them muſt do the like, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the reſt which are to act any thing: And when they are within, they which firſt entred muſt not ſcatter themſelves in the town (whileſt they are yet weak) whether it be in purſuing the enemy, or though they meet none: but they muſt make two bodies, the one to act, the other onely to be put into battalia to ſuſtein the reſt. This done, they muſt march in good order, the one to force that whereunto they are appointed, the other to go and embattel themſelves in the ſtreets and market-places which you had reſolved ought to be ſeiſed upon, by the plat or draught of the town, by which the whole enterpriſe ought to have been deſigned. For howſoever it hath ſometimes ſucceeded well to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

enemy ſpeedily with ſuch few men as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, yet is it not the ſureſt way, becauſe they may be repulſed by a few men; which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſed brave enterpriſes to be fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>There muſt alſo be a third body which muſt ſtand in battalia without during the execution, to the end that if they which entred ſhould be repulſed, they may ſuſtein them; or elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſuch accidents which might befall them by ſome of the enemies troups, which caſually might arrive in that place. If you be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, that troup which is without ſhall make the retreat, and ſhall remain firm in battalia untill that the repulſed troups be recollected and put in order: but if they which entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſters of the town, to hold it they muſt diſarm the townſmen before they diſarm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And being well aſſured of all the corps du-guards and commodious places, the houſes muſt be ſhared, that ſo every man may have his proportion of the bootie, they being not ſuffered to take it any other way; and they which ſhall begin to pillage muſt be ſeverely puniſhed. By this means you may appoint the beſt houſes to them which have beſt deſerved, and do the reſt by lot, whereof no man ſhall have cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain but of his own ill fortune. If it be needfull, in ſuch places as are aſſailed by ſcalado, you may diſpoſe ſome troups of musketiers, which ſhall give fire perpetually upon the flanks; and if you can, you may adde to them ſome fire-lances: and ſuch as give fire at the top of the ladder, muſt ceaſe ſo ſoon as their men begin to mount. I have been more particular in this chapter then in any other; but ſo many enterpriſes have failed

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of aſſaults by ſieges.</head>
                     <p>IN the two chapters of ſurpriſes I have begun with the means to defend ones ſelf, for that we muſt never undertake to attempt the ſurpriſe of any fort, but upon the defects which are to be found in them: ſo that he which knoweth not on which part nor after which manner he ought to make his aſſault, muſt be prepared for all manner of accidents. In theſe two I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to treat of the aſſailing of towns by ſieges, for that you muſt obſerve by what place and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner you are aſſailed, to make a good defenſe againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Sieges are undertaken either by blocking up of towns to famiſh them, or by taking them by force; for both the one and the other you muſt be maſter of the field, and you muſt have two armies, the one to hinder the enemy from undertaking any thing, and the other to form your ſiege. Or in any caſe you muſt be the firſt in the field, that you may ſo fortifie your ſelf before the town you beſiege as you may be able to maintein your ſelf there in ſpite of the furious attempts of the enemy. To get the town which you mean to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege at the eaſier rate, you muſt attempt to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe it when there is but a ſmall garriſon in it: to this end you are to uſe all manner of inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to keep them from the knowledge of your purpoſe to beſiege it; then all on a ſudden you
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7521:77"/>
muſt go and block it up. But if (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your ſtratagemes) you be not able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe it at unawares, or that you apprehend the charge to be too great, it will be better to make ſome other ſiege of leſſe importance: for a town well and obſtinately defended is the ruine of an army; and if it be not taken, it often diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reputation of the commander which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed it.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe, before you undertake any ſuch thing, it muſt be well conſidered on; and you muſt provide your ſelf abundantly of all things neceſſary to effect it. When you form a ſiege, you muſt appoint your quarters (aſmuch as may be) in healthfull places, and be carefull to make them ſpacious enough, and to keep them clean: for you muſt account upon your time of abode there, that your army be not waſted by diſeaſes. You muſt make the quarters of your army ſo near the town beſieged as may be, yet ſo as they be not diſcommodated by their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie: And if the ground be level and lie open round about, the quarters muſt be out of reach of the cannon. You muſt make as many quarters as the places are which you intend to aſſault, or at leaſt as the bigneſſe of the town beſieged, or the ſituation thereof requireth. Nevertheleſſe I would have the Generals quarters to be ſo large, as (in a caſe of neceſſity) it might receive all the troups of the other quarters; If you make a ſiege with a ſmall army, and that the garriſon be ſtrong, you muſt fortifie the quarters one after another, with the whole body of the army; and in this caſe you muſt make the fewer quarters, and attempt the fewer places. But if you find
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7521:78"/>
your ſelf ſtrong enough you may abbridge the buſineſſe and make them all at once. Beſides this, you muſt make a circumvallation wi h forts and redoubts without reach of cannon of the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which ſhall joyn all the quarters one to the other, behind which your army may preſent it ſelf in battalia, and this line muſt be led in ſuch manner as it may poſſeſſe all the commanding places. And if the garriſon of the town beſieged be ſo ſtrong as you may fear to be aſſailed on both ſides, you muſt make another circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the town, the neareſt that may be, that ſo it may require the fewer men to guard it: for it being made to oppoſe your ſelf againſt the town, you need not take care to make it out of the reach of the cannon. For the opening of the trenches, you are to uſe the more or fewer ceremonies, according as the garriſon is ſtrong or weak. If it be ſtrong, you begin by a good fort, and continue by good redoubts along the trenches, leaving onely ſentinels in them. For it is an old errour to think to defend trenches. If the garriſon be weak, you need not make ſo much ado to gain time. The batteries muſt be well ſtrengthened by good moats, and flanked by good corps-du-guards, to preſerve them againſt the ſallies of the beſieged. If there be any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works which are not yet in good defenſe, and which may be carried by force, you muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt them; otherwiſe you muſt approch them by little and little: for it is there where the braveſt defenſe is made, becauſe that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they can eaſilieſt make their ſallies. When the outworks are taken, and the cannon is planted on the counterſcarp, and you ſap into
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7521:78"/>
the moat, and prepare your ſelf to lay over your galleries to get over to the bulwarks, you muſt then place your musketiers all along the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp, that ſo under favour of them and of your cannon you may paſſe over your galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If the moats be drie, they will diſpute it with you, but at laſt the ſtronger overcometh the weaker. If they be full of ſtanding water, that hindereth you not from making your cawſie whereupon you place your gallerie: If they be full of running water, you muſt make uſe of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bridges to put over your miners. When you are got cloſe to the bulwarks, you are to uſe mines (great or ſmall) ſo by little and little to get into the ground, and the retrenchments which may be made behind the bulwarks. I trouble not my ſelf here to ſhew how to make the quarters, forts, circumvallations, the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (that they lie not open to the enemy) the batteries, (that they be well aſſured) the deſcents into the moat, how to aſſail the falſe brayes, how the galleries are to be made, alſo the mines, and the lodgings which are to be made after they be ſprung; becauſe whatſoever may be ſaid on that ſubject is alreadie written, and it muſt be experience that muſt perfect the reſt; where every day ſomething is altered or ſome new thing is added.</p>

                     <p>TO withſtand a ſiege well, the town muſt be well fortified, it muſt have a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſouldiers to defend it; it muſt abound in victuall; and it muſt have good ſtore of arms and munitions of warre: And theſe foure things are ſo neceſſary, as that if there were an abundance of three of them, if the fourth be wanting the reſt will ſerve for nothing. For what will a well fortified place ſerve for if there be not ſouldiers to defend it? or what good will ſouldiers do if they have neither arms nor munitions of warre to fight? neither will arms nor munitions avail, if they want bread to live by; to which I adde inſtruments to work in the earth, without which it is impoſſible to make any great reſiſtance. But it is not enough to have all that is neceſſary for reſiſtance; there muſt be a good order and rule kept, otherwiſe it will all be diſſipated by thoſe which will deſire to get out of danger quickly, and will find ſome pretext to yield upon terms which ſhall not be diſhonourable; the number of ſuch being alwayes greater then of thoſe which will re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by companies of pioners, miners, carpenters, ſmiths, and all artificers uſefull for a ſiege, appointing a commander to every of them.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7521:79"/>
You muſt take an inventory in the town of all the iron, wood, linen, inſtruments to work in the ground, drugs fit for artificiall fires, and other ſuch things neceſſary for a ſiege: and take care that there be alwayes of them in the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins to ſerve for the preſent neceſſity: and to avoid diſorder in the diſtribution of all theſe things, there muſt be a counſel which muſt have the overſight thereof, and which ſhall cauſe all to be delivered out and received in according to the order of the Governour and the Counſel of warre. Theſe things thus put in order, you muſt think upon defenſe, which is done princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally after two wayes, by holding the enemy off by retrenchment, and by hindring him (when he approcheth) by ſallies.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt; it is approved and practiced by all; and he which breaketh ground beſt, and beginneth to diſpute it the furtheſt off, is he which maketh the longeſt reſiſtance. For the ſmalleſt retrenchment without (accommodated with palliſadoes) is hard to be forced. But if it be mined, and that there be another made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, it is a dangerous piece to enter, and you conſtrain the enemy to approch by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and with the ſame ceremonies which are uſed to fall upon the bulwarks and the great moat; ſo that by divers retrenchments you keep off the enemy at a diſtance a long time before he can come to fall upon the counterſcarp, who cannot take away your outworks but by mines, which taketh up good ſtore of time. The moat alſo may be defended if it be dry by portable caſemats (which are called coffers) incircled by little moats or palliſadoes to hinder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7521:80"/>
which are placed in ſeverall places of the great moat to defend it, and not to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the cannon of the aſſailant. The bulwarks are alſo to be defended by retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which you are to make either at the point, or at the middle, or at the gorge, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are capable, and that the mines of the beſiegers do enter forward within the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks. And when all that is forced, the laſt defenſe is a retrenchment of the whole town, reducing it to keep onely one part of it.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond way of defenſe; in ſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſallies to drive back them that work in the approches ſome would have onely ſome few to good purpoſe, in great neceſſitie; alleaging that the beſieged there alwayes loſe ſome men, and of the beſt of them, which they ought to conſerve againſt a ſtrong aſſault; and that oftentimes they which would have a fair pretext to yield the town cauſe their ſouldiers to be maimed by continuall ſallies, to ſhew that they yield not themſelves but through neceſſitie. For mine own part (which do approve of the quantitie of ſallies, and which have alwayes ſeen the works of the aſſailants retarded by them more in one houre then in eight dayes by other defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) I anſwer, that theſe reaſons would carry ſome ſhew if the town were attempted by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault; for they not taking any other but that way at that time, it were fit to preſerve the ſouldiers to withſtand them: but whileſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant getteth ground by little and little, if you defend not the town otherwiſe then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, you muſt loſe it at laſt: wherein your quantitie of ſouldiers ſtandeth you in no
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7521:80"/>
ſtead at all, in ſo much that the care you have taken to preſerve your ſouldiers doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the taking of the town one day; but if by your brave ſallies you ruine batteries, throw down trenches, force the redoubts which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; and when they are within the moat you burn their galleries, they muſt be inforced to begin their work anew as ofttimes as you overthrow it; inſomuch as the beſieger finding himſelf ſo enterteined, he approcheth with much more ceremonie, and at laſt his ſouldiers draw back. So that in my opinion it is very fit that the beſieged ſhould make frequent ſallies; but they muſt make them at ſeverall houres, that ſo they may the better ſurpriſe the enemy with few men (but reſolute) to avoid the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the retreat, and to do no other thing but what is commanded. For though you find not reſiſtance at the falling on, as is uſuall, if you ſtay to little purpoſe, you runne the hazard to be ill led off at the retreat. The other particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of defenſe depend upon thoſe of aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the beſiegers teaching you by neceſſitie what you are to do; wherein there is nothing but practice and experience which can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of Artillery.</head>
                     <p>IT is fit to ſpeak of Artillery after ſieges, ſince it is principally by means thereof that towns are taken; and that ſince this hath been in uſe, there are no places found impregnable, if they be not inacceſſible: It hath changed all the form and matter of fortifications: for in ſtead of towers and ancient walls, which have not been able to reſiſt it, we now make bulwarks and other works of earth. We may ſay that it hath even in a manner altered the manner of making warre. Anciently they began their approches to towns where now we end them: for on the firſt day they lodged on the brim of the moat; and now adayes we muſt go a great way before we come at it: then the circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was made out of reach of arrows onely, now they muſt be made beyond reach of cannon: then it mattered not though the fortreſſes of the encamped armies were overtopped, ſo as they had their other conveniences; now-adayes there muſt be care taken above all things that they be not. In thoſe times two armies were quietly led in batalia at two or three hundred paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from each other, and remained there whole dayes without being able to be diſlodged but by a hazard of a general battel; now one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be before another but out of the reach of the cannon, otherwiſe he that hath moſt of them, or that hath planted them beſt, beateth out the other without fighting. At that time a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of an army could know the order of his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7521:81"/>
enemy at a near diſtance, and form his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, ſeeking his advantages upon the defects of another, and all without danger; now theſe things can no more be obſerved but ſo farre off as you muſt rather truſt to your own good order then upon any defect in that of your enemy. Then one army could charge another without loſing their order, becauſe they had not above two or three hundred paces to march; in theſe times it is impoſſible to obſerve it in ſight of the enemy for half a league together, and to find a plain which ſhall be even and without hindrances. Whereunto I adde further, that without a great exerciſe of marching in batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia you are not able to march a thouſand paces without loſing all your diſtances of battalions and ſquadrons, and by conſequence without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in confuſion. Since therefore the cannon is of ſo great uſe in warre, and hath ſo great a ſhare in the victory, it is neceſſary that you know how to make good uſe of it. It is an engine which all cannot well imploy, for it is of great expenſe, and belongeth onely to great and puiſſant States to make ordinary uſe of them. They tie them to a great charge for draught, there being a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred draught-horſes required to draw one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non for battery through all kinds of wayes, and to ſhoot onely a hundred bullets. By this you may judge according to the number which you mean to imploy what length of ground it taketh up. To mannage one piece of battery well, there muſt be eighteen men: beſides, how many ſmiths, carters, farriers, and other workmen muſt there be in the train to repair the carriages? how many carpenters to make bridges? how
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7521:82"/>
how many pioners to accommodate the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes? Briefly an army which carrieth cannon with it cannot march but leiſurely, and that which hath none can do no great effect: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe times the artillery is an eſſentiall part of an army; but withall, if the Generall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelf to be approched too near, without entrenching himſelf it is impoſſible for him to diſintangle himſelf without fighting, or loſing it; which cannot ſo happen without loſing much of his reputation. For this reaſon he ought to inform himſelf very particularly of all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the artillery: and that he may not be deceived, he muſt know the leaſt even of the ſmalleſt things, namely, of the mixture, founding, proportion, weight, calibre, and carriage; of what wood it muſt be, how it muſt be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the ſeverall wayes, miry or mountainous; how to paſſe rivers, how to ſecure the batteries, as well againſt the cannon of the enemy as againſt his ſallies; what ground the cannon muſt have for his reverſe, what diſtance between piece and piece; in what manner the platform muſt be made, at what diſtance the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are ſufficient, and other things, whereof I do not here ſpecifie the particulars, becauſe others have written of them. It ſufficeth me to ſhew the uſe of artillerie, the chargeableneſſe of it, the turmoil of it, and whereunto it engageth you, to incite Generals not to rely upon others; and to know the benefit and diſcommoditie thereof ſo well, that they may make uſe of the one to their advantage, and avoid the other by their foreſight.</p>

                     <p>AFter the great turmoil of the artillery, I will ſpeak a word of that of the baggage. It is a great ſhame to loſe it, but it is alſo a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to preſerve it when it is exceſſive; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing that bringeth ſo much diſorder to an army: therefore it is highly neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the ſmalleſt proportion that may be, and to make a review of it every moneth; for it groweth in the twinkling of an eye. We are ſo delicate now a dayes as we will hardly carry our arms, much leſſe would we carry a weeks victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all about us. So long as ſuch an abuſe be ſuffered in an army, it will make it ſelf incapable to do any thing that is good. For as in a battel he which can laſt preſerve ſome troups which have not fought, carrieth away the victory; ſo he that laſt keepeth his army in health, complete, and accuſtomed to labour, doth the like: which he cannot do if the ſouldiers be ſo delicate as they cannot carry their baggage. Beſides that, ſickneſſe and famine getteth not into an army, but by this raſcalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie of ſouldiers boyes: and this thing which ſeemeth to be a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is of ſuch importance, as it is for the moſt part the diſſipation of the moſt flouriſhing, yea I dare ſay, of the moſt victorious armies. It is principally in the time of proſperity that men grow effeminate, and give themſelves to take their eaſe; and in that time it ought leaſt to be done, if after the example of the delicacies of <hi>Capua</hi> where <hi>Hannibals</hi> army imbaſed it ſelf,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7521:83"/>
they would not do the ſame. Whilſt we are about cutting off unneceſſary things from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I will ſay a word concerning pioners. There be Captains of our time which will have an unbridled number of them, and ſay, that it were better to cut off ſome regiments of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to take pioners in their ſtead, which are neceſſary to make the incloſures of the camp, the trenches in a ſiege, the accommodation of the wayes; briefly, to take away all imployment from the ſouldiers of working in the ground, for that they in theſe times cannot be brought to be ſubject to ſuch labours as the ancient Romanes were: alledging further, that the ſouldier when he arriveth at his quarter, is ſufficiently tired, though he be not imployed a new to caſt up earth. An opinion whereat I cannot wonder enough, and which ſtrengthneth me in that which I hold, that we ſpoil our ſouldiers by ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them too much. There muſt be care taken for their livelihood, for their clothing, for ſuch as are ſick and hurt: but they muſt be hardned to labour, and their Generall and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders muſt be examples to them. For if you will reduce them to content themſelves with a little whileſt you burſt your ſelf with exceſſe of meat, and to labour whileſt you glory it, and live in lazineſſe; I confeſſe they will murmure. But to return to the pioners: it is neceſſary you ſhould have them to accommodate the wayes, for the artillery principally; for which five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred may ſerve for a great equipage. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the incloſing of the camp, the ſouldier is bound to make it; for that this labour procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him a means to reſt himſelf and to ſleep in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7521:83"/>
ſafetie. I ſay further, that it is a work which muſt be done in three or foure houres; to this end all the army worketh at it, or at leaſt half of it, when the enemy is near hand. So that if we muſt needs have it done by pioners, there had need be as many of them in an army as there are ſouldiers, which would be a means to famiſh a whole countrey, and to encreaſe the turmoil, which we would diminiſh. Concerning the trenches; I never ſaw it ſucceed well when pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did it; and whileſt the danger groweth, the moſt valiant ſouldiers are not too good for that imployment; and further they muſt be incited to that work by the gain of it: which will ſerve to aſſure themſelves the better in that danger, and to give them a means to ſpare ſomething to cloth themſelves; and no money is ſo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as that in an army.</p>

                     <p>THere be yet two ſorts of people whereof (contrary to the pioners) there cannot be too many in an army; which are ſpies and guides. The firſt advertiſe you of the deportments of the enemy, upon whoſe report either you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe ſomething upon him, or you guard your ſelf from his deſignes. The ſecond give you knowledge of the countrey, of the wayes and paſſages by which you are to paſſe, or elſe by what way your enemy can come to you. Both the one and the other muſt be faithfull, for that in adviſing you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alſly, or guiding you maliciouſly, they may cauſe you to fall into great dangers.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7521:84"/>
You muſt have good ſtore of guides: for that (eſpecially if you march by night) every groſſe troup (or at leaſt every body) hath need of their own; and before you ſet forward, they muſt all be agreed on the way which they will take. There muſt be a Captain of the guides, a man of ſpirit, and vigilant, and that may take care to get guides fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place. Concerning ſpies, there muſt be ſomething more obſerved in them, and you muſt be alwayes ſuſpicious of them: for that as it is a dangerous task for him that undertaketh it, ſo it is alſo for him that imployeth them. To this end it is neceſſary that no man know them but he which imployeth them; and that ſpies may not know each other, that ſo they may not agree to give falſe adviſes: for by this means by examining them ſeverally, by the agreement or diſagreement of their adviſes, you may judge whether they be good; and by the verification of thoſe which ſpeak true or falſe, you ſhall know who betrayeth you, or doth you true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And howſoever when you diſcover trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, yet I ſay you may make a profitable uſe of them, by feigning that you believe them to be faithfull, and giving them commiſſions which they may diſcover to the enemy, that you have ſome deſigne quite contrary to that which you intend to put in execution; that ſo whileſt he is preparing himſelf for one ſide, you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſomething upon him on the other. But this is not all, to beware of your own ſpies; you muſt alſo take heed of thoſe of the enemy; which you muſt preſuppoſe you have within your camp, as the enemy hath of yours. For this reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſecreſie which muſt be uſed in all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7521:84"/>
it is good to give a charge, by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in a ſtill way) that you have a quite contrary deſigne to that which you purpoſe to put in execution, that ſo thoſe ſpies may ſo report it to the enemy. But the moſt eſſentiall means to be well ſerved by this kind of men, is to be very liberall to them; for they are faithfull to them which give them moſt.</p>

                     <p>BUt ſeeing it is to no purpoſe to have an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my compoſed of good commanders and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſouldiers, well diſciplined and obedient, well furniſhed with artillery and munition, if they have not what to eat; I will diſtinguiſh this chapter into five parts: the firſt to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of corn; the ſecond to provide for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of it; the third of the ſafe conveying of it; the fourth of the making of good bread; and the fifth of the diſtribution of it. To this end the Commiſſary generall of the victuall ought to be a man of authority, faithfull, vigilant, and active; and this office ought not to be deſpiſed (as now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes it is) nor given to men of mean quality; for it is of ſuch importance, that according as it is either well or ill diſcharged, it cauſeth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſubſiſt, or go to ruine. And the <hi>Romanes</hi> alwayes committed it to ſome eminent perſon. To come to particulars, I will ſay that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of corn ought to be made in due time, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantitie, in a commodious place for tranſportation, and that choice be made of very good corn. For you muſt not conceive any hope
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7521:85"/>
of finding it, either in the champain or towns where you are to go, becauſe the enemy may either hoard it up or burn it; and ſo on that hope you ſhall find in this onely point all your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes fruſtrated. In the ſecond, you muſt make Magazines in divers places, that ſo you may not be in danger to loſe all at once, both in towns and caſtles which are neareſt and moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the tranſporting of corn into your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and (according to the ſituation of the countrey) you are to make proviſion of wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons or mules to carry it to the camp, where muſt alwayes be a Magazine for a forthnight, which ſhould not be meddled with but in extremitie, or for ſome extraordinary enterpriſe. In the third place, the carriage of it ought not to be performed without a good convoy; and never on any prefixed day, to prevent the preparation of taking of it whileſt it is on the way. In the fourth, to hinder the abuſes which are ordinarily uſed (and I dare ſay, ever, unleſſe there be a very narrow looking to it) about the bread. For, for their private gain, they mingle bad grain with it, yea even earth, and uſe other baſe tricks, whence for the moſt part proceed diſeaſes in an army; which is a miſchief which cannot be too ſeverely puniſhed. And in the laſt place, that it may be well diſtributed and not waſted; for if you truſt the Sergeants, they alwayes take for double the number of ſouldiers they have in their companies: to this end it is neceſſary that the Commiſſarie generall of the victuall from week to week ſhould have an exact liſt of thoſe that are in the army, ſigned by the Generall, that ſo he may order the diſtribution of bread accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7521:85"/>
to it. Beſides, you muſt cauſe them to be puniſhed rigourouſly which pillage thoſe victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers and other perſons which bring victuall to the camp; whereof the price muſt be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſo the ſouldiers may not be ſharked upon. When you are at a well retrenched ſiege, where the hope to make you quit it conſiſteth in nothing elſe but in cutting off your victuall, you muſt have that foreſight to cauſe ſo much to be brought within your camp as you judge to be neceſſary to ſerve your turn for the time you believe you ſhall ſtay to take the town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; as <hi>Ceſar</hi> did before <hi>Alexia.</hi> There be many rules to be given on this ſubject, to hinder the abuſes which may be uſed therein, which I omit to avoid prolixitie: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Generall ought to have abſolute power, which ought not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to any: for in warre more then in any other profeſſion the command ought to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: and it is a very bad introduction to make Generals which command the army by the day, or by the week, or by the moneth. At all times when the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ſo, they ſped the worſe for it.</p>
                     <p>Then there muſt be a Lieutenant generall, or Marſhall of the field generall, which ought to take care to cauſe all the Generalls commands to be put in execution as abſolutely as himſelf, thereby to eaſe him: it being too hard a thing for the Generall to do all, eſpecially when the army marcheth; for that (of all neceſſitie) there muſt be a man of eminent authority at the head of an army, and whom all the other commanders do acknowledge. Sometimes there is a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall and a Marſhall of the field gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to perform theſe two offices; nevertheleſſe theſe two places, being born by two men in an army, oftentimes bring confuſion, and cauſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7521:86"/>
that which we deſire to avoid: for in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thereof they never agree; becauſe the Marſhall of the field generall doing his office, muſt diſtribute the commands of the Generall to all the other commanders; he muſt march in the vanguard, order the lodgings and encampings: inſomuch as I know not what function the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall ſhall have unleſſe he uſurp the others office, or elſe that he ſerve onely as a ſhooting trunk, that ſo through him the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals commands may be delivered to the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of the field: which is the reaſon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there ought to be but one of theſe two offices.</p>
                     <p>That done, I divide all the functions of the army into foure principall parts, namely the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, the infanterie, the artillerie, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, and will treat of each part one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The cavalry is a body which often lodgeth ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>parated from that of the army, and requireth a principall commander to whom all the reſt ſhould yield obedience, which muſt be of great authority and eminent qualitie, or of ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and vertue that all the other commanders may voluntarily obey him. For it is in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie, where you ſhall meet with more men of wealth and good families, and conſequently more difficult to be made to obey; and therefore this authoritie ought not to be divided. And becauſe in marching the cavalrie is ordinarily in the front and in the rear, and that in lodging you are ofttimes compelled to make two fronts, and for that in time of battel the horſe are at leaſt on the two wings, it is neceſſary that there be a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7521:87"/>
Lieutenant Generall, a man alſo of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. There muſt further be a third comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom the moſt part call a Commiſſary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who diſtributeth the orders, keepeth the liſt of the guards, of the convoyes, and other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and ought to go and take the orders from the Marſhall of the field generall, to carry them to his Generall of the horſe, who diſtributeth them to the Quarter-maſters, which come for them from every quarter. All the cavalry muſt be divided into companies, of which regiments are formed; not after the manner of the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, under the command of a Colonell; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintein the order of the lodgings and of battel. To form theſe regiments you put foure or five companies together, with one of carabines, and the ancienteſt Captain commandeth that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and ſo all the cavalry is divided: which maketh it plainly evident how merely unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an office it is to have a generall command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the carabines; for the carabines cannot make a body, for that their want of fighting permitteth it not, neither were they inſtituted but to ſerve the cavalry, either at their quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to diſcover, or for intelligence, or to give a charge in the flank in time of fight, or in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to harrie them whom you chace, or to keep you from being ſo when you are purſued.

that the Generall of the horſe giving his orders to the Commiſſary generall, he to the Quarter-maſter generall, and he to the other Quarter-maſters which come for them from the other quarters (where the ſame order is obſerved) the commands are carried without confuſion, and paſſe through the hands of few perſons; and when there is any deficiency found, it is eaſie to be verified whence it aroſe.</p>
                     <p>The infantery is the more ſolid body of an army: that of the artillery and victuall alwayes are quartered with it. There is not that diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie between the companies which is between the horſe; they are all of the ſame faſhion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of half-pikes half-musketiers. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies make a regiment, which hath its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and many regiments make a body, which we call a <hi>Brigado</hi> of the army. The army is uſually divided into three bodies, Vanguard, Battel, and Rearguard. Every brigado hath its commander; and beſides it ought to have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Major of a brigado, and a Quarter-maſter of a brigado; The firſt to go and take the orders from the Marſhall of the field generall, to carry them to the commander of his brigado; then he giveth the word to the Sergeant Majors of the regiments: and the other to give to every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter of a regiment, either his quarter, or the ſpace of ground which is neceſſary, for him to encamp in; and he divideth it to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Quarter-maſters, or to the harbengers of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry company, which afterwards lodgeth them. If there be a Colonel generall of all the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, he may have a care in generall of all the government thereof; but in an army he muſt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7521:88"/>
onely command a brigado, otherwiſe we ſhould not be able to eſtabliſh the order which we have propounded. Moreover, there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers nations which do not judge a Colonell ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the infantery to be neceſſary, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with particular Colonels for every regiment, which acknowledge onely the commands of the Generall, or of his Marſhall of the field generall.</p>
                     <p>The artillery ought to have a Generall, a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall, a Quarter-maſter, then other officers. And for that all pioners, miners, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giniers, conductours of works, ſmiths, carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wheelwrights, and other workmen depend on him, I would eſtabliſh a commander for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort of theſe men; which I would take either out of the commiſſaries of the artillery, or other perſons apart, to addreſſe my ſelf to them when I had need of ſuch men. The Quarter-maſter muſt every night go to receive the orders of the Marſhall of the field generall. The charge of the victuals ought to be performed by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; he ought to have his Lieutenant, his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter, and his other officers: his Quarter-maſter muſt every evening go and take the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Marſhall of the field generall.</p>
                     <p>So then you ſee how the commands are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed: the Marſhall of the field generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth them from the Generall, then goeth to his own lodging; there the Commiſſary of horſe cometh and receiveth them for the cavalry; the Sergeant Major generall for the infantery, who delivereth it to the Sergeant Majors of brigadoes: for the artillery to the Quarter-maſter thereof; and ſo to him for the victuals: Briefly, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7521:88"/>
of the field generall ſpeaking with theſe foure perſons, giveth the orders to all the army. All orders and commands ought to be given in writing. The Marſhall of the field generall, the Generall of the artillery, the Fiſcall, the Control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Exchequer, the Generall of victuall, the Quarter-maſter generall, the Sergeant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor generall and the Provoſt generall muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be lodged within the Generalls quarter.</p>
                     <p>If all the army be encamped in bodies, the Quarter-maſter generall giveth to each of theſe bodies the ſpace of ground which is fitting; which is afterwards diſtributed (in every body) by the officers thereunto appointed.</p>
                     <p>On a day of battel the Marſhall of the field generall doth aſſigne the place for every body; afterwards the Sergeant major generall ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the infantery into battalia.</p>
                     <p>The Marſhall of the field generall ought to have three or foure aſſiſtants for the field, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the extraordinary orders; but they muſt not pretend to command any officer in chief, unleſſe they formerly have been either Colonels or Captains of horſe.</p>
                     <p>The Sergeant major generall muſt command the Colonels; but that they may the readilier obey him, he ought to be taken out of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; and none ought ever to have that place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he hath been one: as alſo the Sergeant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors of brigadoes ought to be taken out of the Sergeant majors of regiments. Things being thus regulated and eſtabliſhed, you ſhall ſee a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie in the commands, and none ſhall be able to excuſe his fault by putting it off upon another, becauſe preſently it will be verified whence it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7521:89"/>

                     <p>AFter that you have formed an army, you muſt imploy it, either for the conqueſt of a new countre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, or for the defenſe of your own. We will begin with the firſt. The Prince which putteth himſelf upon the offenſive muſt be the ſtronger, or muſt ſee ſome garboils in the State which he aſſaileth, and that he be called thither by a partie: otherwiſe it would be a raſh enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>If the countrey which he aſſaileth be large and open, he muſt ſeek in the beginning to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a battel or ſome grand skirmiſh, that ſo by the reputation of his arms he may affright the enemies. If it be a countrey encloſed with mountains, or divided by rivers and ditches, or ſheltered with forreſts, or full of fortreſſes, it is hard to force an enemy to battel; and in this caſe you muſt go to ſieges, and make your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt by little and little. Now he that will make any progreſſe by this way muſt at leaſt have two bodies of armies; that ſo with the one he may hold his enemy in play, and with the other he may actuate without impeachment. For it is moſt difficult to accompliſh the deſigne of a ſiege, ſo long as you have a good army encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near you, which ſhall cut off your victuall. If it be a countrey which is hard to enter, and that hath but few paſſages whereby to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, you muſt force one; and before you go further, you muſt there fortifie, and ſo well aſſure
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7521:89"/>
your way for your victuall as you may not ſuffer though the enemy ſhould have burned or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away that of his countrey into his fortreſſes. If you be called by a faction, that is a very great advantage for you; becauſe you are inſtructed of the ſituation of the countrey, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are to be found in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>tified pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and want not ſpies nor punctuall advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of whatſoever paſſeth amongſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. You muſt alſo be very carefull to uſe this faction very courteouſly, and to engage them by little and little into actions which may make them irreconcilable to their Prince. But when you ſee they make warre with reſpect, and that they will but by halves offend him from whom they have revolted, you muſt have them in great ſuſpicion, and march with them with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in hand: for whether it be the fear of a ruine without recovery, or the hope of a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hindreth them from putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon reall extremities, the one and other are equally dangerous; and at laſt you may fear they may accommodate themſelves to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice: wherefore if they will not engage themſelves to do extraordinary and irremiſſible actions at the beginning, you ought not to joyn with them but under good pledges: You muſt alſo uſe ſuch as do voluntarily yield themſelves to you with all humanitie, clemencie, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, and ſuch as reſiſt you with all ſeveritie; for beneficence towards the one and ſeveritie towards the other are the two principall means which get you obedience. A town taken by force, and hardly uſed, or one which yieldeth it ſelf of its own accord, and favoured, openeth the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7521:90"/>
gates of a dozen others: as on the other ſide, a town taken by force and ſpared, or which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it ſelf voluntarily and is evil intreated, ſhutteth a great many. Whence I conclude, that a Conquerour muſt be as good as his word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he promiſeth, be it in clemency or ſeverity</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the defenſe of States according to their forces and ſituations.</head>
                     <p>TO treat of this ſubject well, we muſt divide it into three parts; namely, into ſmall States, thoſe of a middle rank, and thoſe which are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant. The ſmall ones are of that nature as they ſubſiſt not but by the jealouſies which their neighbours have one of another; for that if one of them will aſſail a weak State, the other will defend it: nevertheleſſe, it is but a tottering condition and ill aſſured; for if the one findeth himſelf able enough to aſſail them, the other will not find himſelf ſufficient to defend them. The counſels of Princes and States are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes governed ſo equally, but for the moſt part one prevaileth above the other. Beſides this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience there is yet another, that ſometimes they agree to divide the prey; ſo that ſuch kind of pettie States which have not ſtrength within themſelves for their own defenſe, are alwayes in perill; and they muſt uſe very much pliant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to remove all pretexts from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of undertaking ſomething againſt them. The onely means which they have is to have one or two towns exceeding well fortified, with arms and money enough to defend them well;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7521:90"/>
that ſo they may give leiſure to them which will not ſuffer the growth of him which ſhall aſſail you, to aid you: for if you have no means at all to reſiſt, your countrey will be taken before they ſhall have time to aſſiſt you: and beſides that, the happineſſe which they conceive of conquering you giveth them a ſpur to aſſail you; you ſhall find many more perſons diſpoſed to ſuccour you then to reconquer your countrey: for that the one is eaſie with equall forces, and the other without greater ſtrength is very difficult. To which I adde, that there is ofttimes as great danger that he which regaineth your countrey as your friend keep it not for himſelf, as well as he which had taken it as your enemy: or if he reſtore it to you, it will be with ſo hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as you ſhall poſſeſſe but the ſhadow of a Sovereigntie. And thrice happy are they which meet with ſo good and ſo generous Princes, which do reeſtabliſh them into their loſt States, with the ſame authoritie and liberty as they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed them before: for ſuch examples are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rare. Concerning thoſe States of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle condition, I propound a Prince (or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) which for his defenſe is able to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein an army of 20000 foot and 3000 horſe with all neceſſary equipage. If his countrey be of a difficult acceſſe, and that there be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it but by certain paſſages and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains guarded and fortified, he hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: but they which too much do truſt and reſt upon them, and have neglected other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes, have deceived themſelves, and have been loſt by thoſe wayes wherein they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt aſſured. If it be encompaſſed by the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7521:91"/>
ſea, it is a fair moat, notwithſtanding he which is ſtronger will find means to make his deſcent into the iſland. If it be environed with mooriſh grounds and rivers, yet an enemy will find wayes to paſſe them, eſpecially when he hath artillery to favouriſe ſuch paſſages; inſomuch that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way is to truſt to your own forces, namely a good army and good fortreſſes: I ſay, both joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together: for that the army without fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being weak, and not daring to hazard any thing, leaveth the victuall of the champain to the enemy, and ſo the means to ſubſiſt at your charge, and at laſt to ruine you. And fortreſſes without an army are not able to preſerve you longer then the time you have made your maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of victuall for, within them: but theſe things being proportioned with judgement, you may make a great reſiſtance. In theſe things you muſt not ſuffer your ſelf to be led by the fanſies of the people, which without conſidering the ſituations of their towns, or the publick good, when they ſee their neighbours fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will all imitate them; a thing equally dangerous, to have more fortreſſes then you can guard, or to have none at all. Yet I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the laſt then the firſt: for that at leaſt by hazarding a battel you put your enemy to half the fear; but by the other way you muſt ſurely periſh, without being able to do any other thing but prolong your ruine: for the jealouſie which you have to preſerve all your fortreſſes by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great garriſons in them, hindreth you of the means of keeping an army in the field: and then the ſpoil of two or three harveſts compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you to yield your neck to the halter. I know
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7521:91"/>
there are ſome which ground themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reaſon, That when all the principall places of a State be fortified, all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall of the champain may be drawn into them, ſo that an army coming thither, if it ſtayeth there, it dieth through famine; and if it doth but paſſe through, it doth no great hurt: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is almoſt impoſſible to make any great ſiege there. Whereunto I anſwer, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes are principally invented for the weaker, that ſo a few men may reſiſt a great number: and if you have ſo great a number of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and thoſe requiring great guards (as the great fortified towns do) you muſt have a greater number of ſouldiers then he ſhall have which cometh to aſſail you; otherwiſe you were not able to provide them all with ſufficient gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons to preſerve them from a ſiege. And if you be the ſtronger without any fortified place, you ſhall preſerve your countrey in keeping the field. There is yet a further inconvenience in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of great towns; that is, that you make them ſo proud as they will not acknowledge their Sovereigne but upon good terms; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt diſcommoditie they receive in any warre the inhabitants deſire rather to change their maſter then to ſee their goods waſted. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that I conclude, that you ought to have ſo few fortreſſes that they may not hinder you from keeping the field; that thoſe which you have be ſo well fortified and furniſhed with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as they may make a great reſiſtance; and to place them ſo well as they may bridle the great towns, and that they may aſſure the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, that ſo the enemy may make difficultie to leave a place behind him which might diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7521:92"/>
his victuall, and that by intelligence or otherwiſe he may not ſeiſe upon ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall town which may ſerve him for a ſeat to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein warre within the countrey. Theſe things thus diſpoſed of, you muſt regard what enemy aſſaileth you. If it be a power of confederates united together, it is the more eaſie to diſunite, then when it dependeth on one alone: and in this caſe it is exceeding good to cauſe ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to grow betwixt them, by feigning of intelligence with ſome one of the confederates, to whom ſhewing more reſpect and leſſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſitie, you may give jealouſie to the reſt: as alſo by procuring a diverſion upon the countrey of one of the reſt. It being a very difficult thing that many ſovereigne powers ſhould long hold a league together, without ſome diſguſts to ariſe amongſt them, or miſtakings, envies, and even enmities, by reaſon of the diverſitie of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and intereſts; ſo that that power which onely dependeth upon one State onely, is much more to be feared. And becauſe you may be aſſailed more or leſſe fiercely, I muſt ſay a word for that: If it be by forces which are not too much diſproportionable to yours, you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your countrey without forſaking it, and with your army and fortreſſes tie up the enemy, in hindring him from victuall; and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching alwayes ſo near him as you ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from making any ſiege of importance. For if a Conquerour advanceth not forward he recoileth; and it is impoſſible for him to ſubſiſt in a countrey which he would conquer, if at firſt he taketh no footing, and doth not ſtrengthen himſelf by ſome conſiderable priſe. If alſo you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7521:92"/>
be aſſailed by a power altogether diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to your forces; in this caſe you muſt leave the field, and burn all the victuall which you cannot contein within your fortreſſes, and alſo all the towns and villages which you cannot guard: for it is better for you to preſerve your ſelf in a ruined countrey, then to keep it for your enemy. And it is in this that a Prince, to gain, as he thinketh, the name of being compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate towards his people (which in ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions turn their backs upon him) becometh cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el towards himſelf: But it is rather a vice of irreſolution and of weakneſſe of courage which poſſeſſeth us, then a true compaſſion which we have of the misfortune of another: as that of the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> who upon the firſt ill fortune that befell him (his forces being yet entire) durſt not trie the hazard of a battel any more. And he who could not afford any pitie to <hi>Galba</hi> in his decrepit age (being his deſigned ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to the Empire) and which had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all kinds of villanies to attein it, would perſwade poſterity, that compaſſion to ſee the <hi>Romane</hi> bloud ſhed had made him reſolve to eſtrange himſelf from it by killing himſelf. Thus it is that we oftentimes deſire to cover our vices with the vertue which is neareſt thereunto. But as it is a maxime, that no publick good can be without ſome prejudice to ſome particular men, ſo a Prince cannot diſintangle himſelf from a perilous enterpriſe, if he will pleaſe every man. And the greateſt and moſt uſuall faults which we commit in matters of State and war proceed from ſuffering our ſelves to be carried away with this complacencie, whereof we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7521:93"/>
us when there is no remedy left. But to avoid ſuch ſtorms you muſt hold this for a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall law for your own preſervation, Never to ſuffer that neighbour of yours to grow up which maketh himſelf the ſtrongeſt: for it is better to offend him by hindring him from enabling himſelf to deſtroy you, then to ſuffer him to grow greater out of fear to offend him. It being a thing certain, that no man preſerveth his libertie againſt a conquering enemy by comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but onely by force.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth that we ſpeak of puiſſant States which (without help of another) have arms, money, and what elſe is needfull to maintein a continuall warre.</p>
                     <p>Of this kind there be but few, and they need to care for none but themſelves; for that one ſole enemy is not able to aſſail them, and that it is hard for the leagues of ſeverall Princes all to agree in ſuch a deſigne, or for any long time to ſubſiſt together: Nevertheleſſe I will ſay a word on this ſubject. Great States are either compacted altogether, or ſpread abroad in ſeverall places: the firſt, which have all their forces united, are able to aſſail, and to defend themſelves more powerfully then they which are ſo ſeparated; becauſe they carry all their forces where need requireth with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and facilitie, and leſſe charge: the other put a great part of the world into an alarm and jealouſie, becauſe they frontier upon the greateſt number of States. Nevertheleſſe, if the one or the other be aſſailed, they muſt make uſe of the defenſes we propounded before: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will ſay that they ought to have no fortreſſes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7521:93"/>
but good ones, and few in number, and onely on the frontiers, and none within the heart of the countrey; for that having more cauſe to fear civil warres then forrein, and without which no man will ever aſſail a great Empire, it is the way to take away the main root from them which maketh them to undertake the enterpriſe and to ſubſiſt. Beſides, you ought not to perpetuate any governments, neither to families, nor yet for life. But the principall and moſt able remedy againſt civil warre is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein a forrein warre; which chaſeth away idleneſſe, ſetteth all on work, and particularly giveth ſatisfaction to ambitious and ſtirring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: it baniſheth luxurie, it maketh your people warlike, and mainteineth you in ſuch reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt your neighbours, as you are the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratour of all their differences. It is true that this maxime is not good to be obſerved but by ſuch States as are of this laſt ſort. For as it is neceſſary for them, I find it hurtfull for pettie States, which muſt fear all ſorts of warre; for being too weak to gain by it, they run the hazard to be the pray of ſuch as are the ſtronger,</p>

                     <p>A Sovereigne Prince is more capable to make great and ready conqueſts then a common-wealth; for that finding himſelf ſecret in his counſel, courageous in his reſolution, ready in his execution, and not fearing to be contradicted by any, he maketh more conqueſts in ten years of his life, then a common-wealth which is leſſe ſecret, which is long in reſolving, which bridleth the authoritie of her Captains, and which every houre contradicteth their actions, ſhall be able to do in a hundred yeares: So alſo a common-wealth which goeth alwayes upon her own maximes, which is not ſubject to the want of one perſon, and whoſe government receiveth no alteration by the death of any of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth much better and for a longer time that which ſhe hath conquered then a Prince; which ofttimes (and almoſt alwayes) hath a ſucceſſour as much a heartleſſe dullard as himſelf was ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. Nevertheleſſe, I will here eſtabliſh (as well for the one as for the other) the true maximes for the well aſſuring of a conqueſt: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in two things; namely to take away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revolting from thoſe whom you have conquered, and the means of being able to do it.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, it is a thing very certain, that if you conquer a free people, you ſhall not take away (at leaſt during the life of thoſe which have lived ſo) their deſire to recover their liberty. If they be ſubjects to a Prince and a State, and that they have onely changed their maſter, they will rather deſire to remain under the authoritie of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7521:94"/>
him which ſhall uſe them the moſt courteouſly. Therefore you muſt alwayes begin by a fair way, and to eſtabliſh a condition for them which you have conquered which may be ſure, both for their life and for their goods. For if even your own ſubjects find not this aſſurance, it is to be feared they will revolt; how much more they which are newly conquered? it being a law of nature imprinted in every creature, that the meaneſt and leaſt <hi>animal</hi> taketh care for its own conſervation; to which man endued with reaſon addeth the conſervation of his honour and his welfare, which he ofttimes preferreth before his own life. Therefore a Prince muſt govern accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exact juſtice, uphold the oppreſſed in his due right, abſtein from all violence himſelf, aſwel concerning the honour of their wives as for their goods: for without this it is impoſſible to make a conquered people tractable. You muſt alſo (ſo much as may be) maintein them in the form of their government, &amp; exclude none of them out of the poſſibility of atteining to thoſe offices, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and honours which they may poſſeſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to your ſafetie. And if it be a Prince which maketh this conqueſt, the means to aſſure himſelf well therein is there to eſtabliſh his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the moſt that may be; for that his preſence doth hinder many diſorders, the ſplendour of his court imprinteth a certain veneration into the minds of the people, and it bringeth gain to the artificers and citizens where it is kept.</p>
                     <p>If it be a common-wealth which cannot change the ſeat of their government, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary that ſuch as they ſhould ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to govern live there with ſplendour. For
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7521:95"/>
the people is ſometimes more taken with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance then realitie. Theſe are the means which do inſenſibly inſinuate obedience into a newly conquered people: but becauſe this is not ſufficient, and that ofttimes the facilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting impunely cauſeth men to have a deſire to it, it is neceſſary for you to precaution your ſelf by requiſite aſſurances, which conſiſt in having their arms and fortreſſes in your own hands: I mean not that all the people ſhall be wholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, for if it be poſſible it muſt not come to that; but to aſſure your ſelf of great communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by good fortreſſes; to have arcenals in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts, and not all in one place; and not to leave any town or caſtle (except your fortreſſes of garriſon) ſo ſtrong as to be able to endure 100 cannon-bullets. There is a laſt means, whereof the ancients made a profitable uſe, and is now wholly left, which I do marvellouſly approve of; which is, to eſtabliſh colonies, and to tranſport the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from one countrey to another. For beſides that it is a great bridle to keep a conquered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in aw, you recompenſe by this means the nearer part of thoſe ſouldiers which have done you good ſervice. And I find not the reaſon to be ſufficient which ſome alledge, that it is cruelty to make this permutation, and that it is againſt charity; but to the contrary I find indeed thoſe remedies to be cruel which are commonly uſed, to keep the people ſo under as they have nothing but their life, and cannot hope for any honour within their own countrey. For my ſelf I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe freely, that I had rather be driven out of my countrey into another, where I ſhould have a hope for my ſelf and mine to be able to attein to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7521:95"/>
ſomething more then now I am, then to remain in mine own countrey to be deprived of that hope; finding nothing to be ſo hard as to take away hope from a man, which is that which in this world, and for the goods of this world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him undertake all things; and which for the goods of the other world furniſheth him with conſtancy to ſuffer all things: Moreover, there is nothing which diſtinguiſheth a man ſo much from a beaſt, nor yet a regenerate man from a ſenſuall, as hope. Which maketh me conclude, that you ſhould never take from a man the hope of being able to obtein a better condition then that which he poſſeſſeth, that ſo he be not caſt into deſpair.</p>

                     <p>ONe of the moſt honourable actions which a Prince doth, and which bringeth him moſt reputation, is to ſuccour his allies in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities: but it is a thing which for the moſt part is very difficult. When you will make war, you chooſe your advantages, and you take your time and your meaſures according to that which you can and will do: it is not ſo in the ſuccouring of your allie, which muſt be aſſiſted with ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and diſcommodities as you meet with. If his countrey be joyned to yours, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindreth you from aſſiſting him with all your forces united, you cannot excuſe the not doing of it, unleſſe it be that you fear his enemy, and would not offend him; which is an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and no judicious reaſon. For by this excuſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7521:96"/>
you eſcape not the danger which your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours loſſe will draw upon you. It being much better for you to reſiſt joyntly, then ſuffer your ſelves to be undone one after another. But if it be an allie ſeparated from you by other Princes and States (which ofttimes ſo hapneth) and that you meet with great difficulties to get into his countrey, you muſt then well conſider after what manner you ſhould ſuccour him: for if the States which are between you both refuſe you paſſage, and that you muſt be enforced to give them bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel before you be able to aſſiſt your allie, it is to be feared that you ſhall not be able to ſuccour him timely enough. And if your neighbour, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for fear of you, or of him which aſſaileth your allie, do offer you paſſage, you cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof with ſafety, unleſſe he put you in poſſeſſion of thoſe places which are neceſſary to aſſure your return; which being refuſed you, you muſt go no further. But if the enemy of your ally hath territories near you, and ſuch as you may eaſily aſſail; you muſt do it ſtoutly; and that ſuccour which can be given by diverſion is (in my opinion) the ſureſt and that which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt; becauſe you do it with all your forces and conveniences, and ordinarily that countrey which you aſſail is not well provided, becauſe he which aſſaileth another State leadeth out with him the beſt Captains and ſouldiers which he hath. But if you want all theſe means, there is no other left but that of money, wherewith you may aſſiſt him; which ofttimes is not ſufficient to ſave him.</p>

                        </gap> in perſon or by Lieutenants: for that the practice thereof being different, every man bringeth his beſt reaſons to maintein his opinion. They which diſapprove of his doing it in perſon alledge, that by going out of his territories he openeth the doore for diſorders, and robbeth himſelf of the means to prevent them; that it is more neceſſary for him to keep peace within then to make war abroad, for which nothing can do ſo much good as his preſence, which keepeth in aw the moſt ſtirring ſpirits; that holding them which are within in obedience he may give the better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his affairs abroad; that there befall greater inconveniences and leſſe remediable, when the Prince is ingaged in perſon out of his countrey, then when he is within it; that if he ſhall receive ſome check in his perſon being farre from his owne territories, thoſe buſie heads are more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make innovations, every man emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth himſelf and ſhaketh off his obedience; if he be ſlain there, his ſubjects are affrighted, and his enemie is encouraged by it, and thence draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great advantages; if he be taken, that is ſtill worſe; for none being able to declare himſelf Prince, and the great ones, deſiring to make their benefit of his calamity, put all affairs into ſuch a confuſion that nothing is done in the State with authoritie, becauſe they which ſeiſe upon the government tyrannize over the other great
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7521:97"/>
ones which might pretend the ſame, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times love rather to call in the common enemy then to obey their fellows. Whereunto they adde, that a Prince cannot free himſelf without giving great advantages to his enemy, which turn to a notable and irremediable prejudice both to himſelf and his State: So that all things being balanced, they conclude that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences are much greater of hazarding the perſon of the Prince in the warres then to cauſe them to be managed by his Lieutenants. This opinion is principally mainteined by men of the gown, naturall enemies to ſouldiers; who for that they can better preſerve their authoritie in peace then war, do not onely diſſwade from going in perſon to the warre, but even do adviſe the ſuffering of all ſorts of ignominy rather then to make war. Whereunto flatterers, panders, and all the plagues of Princes do adhere, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertein them within their countrey in a lazineſſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> bringeth them to all ſorts of luxurie, making them believe that their States are but made for them, and not they for their States; that the taking of a maidenhead is more honourable then the conqueſt of a Province; that there belongeth more induſtry and trouble to the well-ordering of a feaſt then of a battel; that labour is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but onely for porters; and that great Kings ſhould cauſe all things to be acted without moving themſelves: which is the uſuall way of the loſſe of kingdomes and empires. They which counſel a Prince to make warre in perſon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the command of an army is a morſell ſo delicious that it ought not to be imparted to others without great neceſſitie: for that to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7521:97"/>
a mans ſelf well in ſuch a charge, he muſt be very abſolute; and ofttimes the Generall of an army doth not contein himſelf within his dutie, eſpecially when the Prince performeth not his own. For in this caſe he is naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of the glory of another, and cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the good actions of his Lieutenant, though they tend to his own profit. In which humour they do entertein him which govern the affairs at court, with this fear, leaſt that an eminent vertue ſhould ſupplant them. And from hence proceedeth the infelicitie of the moſt part of brave deſignes, how well ſoever undertaken, which are made to periſh either for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or of victuall, or by reſtraining the authority of the Generall, or by putting officers upon him which oppoſe him, and which prove rather ſhackles to him then aſſiſtants: and when affairs have not ſucceeded as men imagined, the fault is caſt upon him which is innocent, and the blameworthy triumph: and thus great Princes ſhal be ſerved which make war by their Lieutenants: That the reputation of a Prince who is a good commander himſelf is much greater then a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which hath good commanders: that the firſt is feared for his own worth, and the other onely through others: that the firſt cannot betray himſelf, but that the commanders of the other may be corrupted: that the firſt can make choice of ſuch as are fit for warre, and the other hath no good commanders but by hazard: that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the one is not ſo envied nor croſſed, ſeeing he is maſter, and is to give account of his actions to no man; but that the Generall of the army of another is ſubject to a perpetuall jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7521:98"/>
and thrice happy is he that eſcapeth it: that the means to prevent civil warres is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the moſt ſtirring and courageous ſpirits in forrein warres, where they ſhall find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſatisfie their ambitions; as alſo to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes armed, becauſe that will cool thoſe which are hotteſt: and that the Prince be at the head of his army, that ſo none may uſe it againſt him. They alledge further, that never Prince hath founded a great Empire, but by making warre in perſon; nor hath loſt any, but when he made warre by his Lieutenants. It is now left to the choice of Princes what is to be done upon theſe two adviſes. If he be a drone, which contenteth himſelf to be admired by his grooms, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no delight but in voluptuouſneſſe, and which leaveth off the acting of the part of a King to act that of a ſcoundrel, he will never take that counſel to command his armies himſelf. If he be a wiſe Prince, which loveth tranquillitie to maintein his people in juſtice, nevertheleſſe he will not omit to be prepared for warre, and to inform himſelf therein, that ſo when occaſion ſhall ſerve he need not commit the command of his armies to others. But if he be a generous Prince which hunteth after glory, and deſireth to imitate thoſe great men which live ſtill 2000 years after their death, and whoſe venerable names at this day do honor thoſe which mention them, he will doubtleſſe chooſe for his principall imployment that of war; wherein he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to make himſelf expert, that ſo he need not depend upon others for the leading of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and will make that his chief delight. And this is the true pleaſure which contenteth the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7521:98"/>
ſpirit, which is particular to man, and common to great men: for corporall pleaſure hath more of the beaſt then of man; and ſo he that wholly addicteth himſelf thereunto is worſe then a brute beaſt.</p>

                     <p>IT is a thing which cannot be conceived, how available the reputation of a Generall of an armie is; and how hard it is to be preſerved. For after that you have acquired the eſtimation of being a wiſe man, and of great managing, if you will conſerve it by prudence, men will ſay you are become a coward; and if by hazarding ſome battel you receive a check, they will hold you to be raſh. So that there is no function in the world more ſubject to blame then that of a Generall of an arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; and very happy is that commander which keepeth his reputation entire untill the the end. Nevertheleſſe ſo long as it laſteth it worketh marvellous effects: for when he hath gotten the name of being proſperous in war, the ſouldiers believe that he cannot be beaten; and go upon his word ſo ſecurely to the combat, as they take no more knowledge of the danger; perſwading themſelves that he never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to fight, but that he is aſſured of the victory: which doth ſo encourage them as they fight with much the more reſolution. Moreover, the enemies meeting with ſuch a man, fight not but in fear, as being aſſured to be beaten. There be a thouſand of ancient and modern examples of this truth. When the army of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> (even when he was abſent) was beaten, the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:7521:99"/>

The ſole reputation of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who was taken notice of in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of <hi>Fontaine Francoiſe,</hi> arriving there the day before in poſt, made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abandon <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi> I have obſerved the <hi>Dauphinois</hi> to have this belief, that the Conſtable le <hi>Deſdiguires</hi> could not be beaten. But as this opinion is of great profit to a Generall of an army when he hath atteined it, ſo to be thought unluckie in warre is a great hindrance to him: for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to aſſure himſelf on thoſe ſouldiers which have ſuch an opinion of their Commander. Therefore a Generall of an army muſt make it his principall aim to begin well; then not to omit any thing for the preſerving of what he hath gotten: reſolving rather to die gloriouſly in ſome great action then to linger out a ſhamefull life after that he hath committed ſome unmanly act. For as the profeſſion of war is that of all others which conferreth moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon a man which therein acquitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well, ſo it draweth the greateſt infamy upon him that demeaneth himſelf ill.</p>
